<p>Published originally in &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s 
Magazine&rsquo; four and six years ago, and now a good deal 
extended, these two papers, I think, will be welcome to many in 
East Anglia who knew my father, and to more, the world over, who 
know FitzGerald&rsquo;s letters and translations.&nbsp; I may say
this with the better grace and greater confidence, as in both 
there is so much that is not mine, and both have already brought 
me so many kindly letters&mdash;from Freshwater, Putney Hill, 
Liverpool, Cambridge, Aldeburgh, Italy, the United States, India,
and &ldquo;other nations too tedious to mention.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
the illustrations <!-- page viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>have been made in Bohemia from 
photographs taken by my elder sister, except Nos. 6, 8, and 9, 
the first of which is from the well-known photograph of 
FitzGerald by Cade of Ipswich, whilst the other two I owe to my 
friend, Mr Edward Clodd.</p>

3</span>A SUFFOLK PARSON.</h2>
<p>The chief aim of this essay is to present to a larger public 
than the readers of a country newspaper my father&rsquo;s Suffolk
stories; but those stories may well be prefaced by a sketch of my
father&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Such a sketch I wrote shortly after 
his death, for the great &lsquo;Dictionary of National 
Biography.&rsquo;&nbsp; It runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Robert Hindes Groome, Archdeacon of 
Suffolk, was born at Framlingham in 1810.&nbsp; Of Aldeburgh 
ancestry, he was the second son of the Rev. John Hindes Groome, 
ex-fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and rector for 
twenty-six years of Earl Soham and Monk Soham in Suffolk.&nbsp; 
From Norwich school he passed to Caius College, Cambridge, where 
he graduated B.A. in 1832, M.A. in 1836.&nbsp; In 1833 he was 
ordained to the Suffolk curacy of Tannington-with-Brandish; in 
1835 travelled through Germany as tutor to Rafael Mendizabal, the
son of the <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Spanish ambassador; in 1839 became 
curate of Corfe Castle, Dorsetshire; and in 1845 succeeded his 
father as rector of Monk Soham.&nbsp; Here in the course of 
forty-four years he built the rectory-house and school, restored 
the fine old church, erected an organ, and re-hung the 
bells.&nbsp; He was Archdeacon of Suffolk from 1869 till 1887, 
when failing eyesight forced him to resign, and when the clergy 
of the diocese presented him with his portrait.&nbsp; He died at 
Monk Soham, 19th March 1889.&nbsp; Archdeacon Groome was a man of
wide culture&mdash;a man, too, of many friends.&nbsp; Chief among
these were Edward FitzGerald, William Bodham Donne, Dr Thompson 
of Trinity, and Henry Bradshaw, the Cambridge librarian, who said
of him, &lsquo;I never see Groome but what I learn something 
new.&rsquo;&nbsp; He read much, but published little&mdash;a 
couple of charges, a sermon and lecture or two, some hymns and 
hymn-tunes, and a good many articles in the &lsquo;Christian 
Advocate and Review,&rsquo; of which he was editor from 1861 to 
1866.&nbsp; His best productions are his Suffolk stories: for 
humour and tenderness these come near to &lsquo;Rab and his 
Friends.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An uneventful life, like that of most country clergymen.&nbsp;
But as Gainsborough and Constable took their subjects from level 
East Anglia, as Gilbert White&rsquo;s Selborne has little to 
distinguish it above other parishes in Hampshire, <a 
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5" 
class="citation">[5]</a> <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>so I believe that the story of that 
quiet life might, if rightly told, possess no common charm.&nbsp;
I have listened to my father&rsquo;s talks with Edward 
FitzGerald, with William Bodham Donne, and with two or three 
others of his oldest friends; such talks were like chapters out 
of George Eliot&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; His memory was 
marvellous.&nbsp; It seems but the other day I told him I had 
been writing about Clarendon; and &ldquo;Clarendon,&rdquo; he 
said, &ldquo;was born, I know, in 1608, but I forget the name of 
the Wiltshire parish his birthplace.&nbsp; Look it 
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked it up, and the date <i>was</i> 1608; 
the parish (Dinton) was, sure enough, in Wiltshire.&nbsp; Myself 
I have had again to consult an encyclop&aelig;dia for both date 
and place-name, but he remembered the one distinctly and the 
other vaguely after possibly thirty years.&nbsp; In the same way 
he could recall the whole plot of a play which he had not seen 
for half a century.&nbsp; Holcroft&rsquo;s &lsquo;Road to 
Ruin,&rsquo; thus, was one that he once described to me.&nbsp; He
was a master of the art, now wellnigh lost, of &ldquo;capping 
verses&rdquo;; and he had a rare knowledge of the less-known 
Elizabethan dramatists.&nbsp; In his first Charge occurs a 
quotation from an &ldquo;old play&rdquo;; and one of his hearers,
Canon &ldquo;Grundy,&rdquo; inquired what play it might be.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ford&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said my father, 
&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>pity she&rsquo;s no better than she 
should be.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And the good man was perfectly 
satisfied.&nbsp; But stronger than his love of Wordsworth and 
music, of the classics and foreign theology, was his love of 
Suffolk&mdash;its lore, its dialect, its people.&nbsp; As a young
man he had driven through it with Mr D. E. Davy, the antiquary; 
and as archdeacon he visited and revisited its three hundred 
churches in the Norwich diocese during close on a score of 
years.&nbsp; I drove with him twice on his rounds, and there was 
not a place that did not evoke some memory.&nbsp; If he could 
himself have written those memories down!&nbsp; He did make the 
attempt, but too late.&nbsp; This was all the result:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Oct.</i> 23, 1886.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see to read, but as yet I can see to 
write.&nbsp; That is, I can see the continuous grey line of 
writing, and can mechanically write one word after another.&nbsp;
But if I leave off abruptly, I cannot always remember what was 
the last word that I wrote, and read it generally I cannot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p6.jpg">
<img alt="Monk Soham Church" src="images/p6.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be thankful for being able to write at all, 
and I hope I am; but I am not enough thankful.&nbsp; The failure 
of my sight has been very gradual, but of late it has been more 
sudden.&nbsp; Three months ago I could employ myself in reading; 
now I cannot, save with a book, such as the <!-- page 7--><a 
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Prayer-book, 
with which I am well acquainted, and which is of clear large 
type.&nbsp; So that as yet I can take my duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born at Framlingham on January 18, 1810, so that 
I am now nearly seventy-seven years old.&nbsp; The house still 
stands where I was born, little if at all changed.&nbsp; It is 
the first house on the left-hand side of the Market Hill, after 
ascending a short flight of steps.&nbsp; My father, at the time 
of my birth, was curate to his brother-in-law, Mr Wyatt, who was 
then rector of Framlingham.&nbsp; I was the younger of two sons, 
my brother Hindes being thirteen months older than I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we left Framlingham in 1813, my recollections of it 
are very indistinct.&nbsp; I have an impression of being taken 
out to see a fire; but as I have since been told that the fire 
happened a year before I was born, I suppose that I have heard it
so often spoken of that in the end I came to believe that I 
myself had seen it.&nbsp; Yet one thing I can surely remember, 
that, being sent to a dame&rsquo;s school to keep me out of 
mischief, I used to stand by her side pricking holes in some 
picture or pattern which had been drawn upon a piece of 
paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1813, after the death of Mr Wyatt, my father took 
the curacy of Rendlesham, where we lived till the year 
1815.&nbsp; The rector of Rendlesham at that time was Dr <!-- 
page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>Henley, <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8" 
class="citation">[8]</a> who was also principal of the East India
College of Haileybury, so that we lived in the rectory, Dr Henley
rarely coming to the parish.&nbsp; That house remains unchanged, 
as I shall have occasion to tell.&nbsp; Lois Dowsing was our 
cook, and lived nearly forty years in my father&rsquo;s 
service&mdash;one of those faithful servants who said little, but
cared dearly for us all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Rendlesham I have clear recollection, and things 
that happened in it.&nbsp; It was there I first learnt to 
read.&nbsp; My mother has told me that I could not be taught to 
know the letter H, take all the pains she could.&nbsp; My father,
thinking that the fault lay in the teacher, undertook to 
accomplish the task.&nbsp; Accordingly he drew, as he thought, 
the picture of a hog, and wrote a capital H under it.&nbsp; But 
whether it was the fault of the drawing&mdash;I am inclined to 
think that it was&mdash;or whether it was my obstinacy, but when 
it was shown me, I persisted in calling it &lsquo;papa&rsquo;s 
grey mare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a high sandbank not far from the house, 
through which the small roots of the bushes growing 
protruded.&nbsp; My brother and I never touched these.&nbsp; We 
believed that if we pulled one of them, a bell would ring and the
devil would appear.&nbsp; So we never pulled them.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>In 
a ploughed field near by was a large piece of ground at one end, 
with a pond in the middle of it, and with many wild cherry-trees 
near it.&nbsp; I can remember now how pretty they were with their
covering of white blossoms, and the grass below full of 
flowers&mdash;primroses, cowslips, and, above all, 
orchises.&nbsp; But the pond was no ordinary one.&nbsp; It was 
always called the &lsquo;S pond,&rsquo; being shaped like that 
letter.&nbsp; I suspect, too, that it was a pond of ill 
repute&mdash;perhaps connected with heathen worship&mdash;for we 
were warned never to go near its edge, lest the Mermaid should 
come and <i>crome</i> us in.&nbsp; <i>Crome</i>, as all East 
Anglians know, means &lsquo;crook&rsquo;; and in later years I 
remember a Suffolk boy at Norwich school translated a passage 
from the &lsquo;Hecuba&rsquo; of Euripides, in which the aged 
queen is described as &lsquo;leaning upon a crooked staff,&rsquo;
by &lsquo;leaning upon a <i>crome</i> stick,&rsquo; which I still
think was a very happy rendering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not far also from the rectory was a cottage, in which 
lived a family by the name of Catton.&nbsp; Close to the cottage 
was a well, worked by buckets.&nbsp; When the bucket was not 
being let down, the well was protected by a cover made of two 
hurdles, which fell down and met in the middle.&nbsp; These 
hurdles, be it noted, were old and apparently rotten.&nbsp; One 
day I was playing near the well, and nothing would, I suppose, 
satisfy me but I must <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>climb up and creep over the 
well.&nbsp; In the act of doing this I was seen by Mrs Catton, 
who saved me, perhaps, from falling down the well, and carried me
home, detailing the great escape.&nbsp; Well do I remember, not 
so much the whipping, as the being shut up in a dark closet 
behind the study.&nbsp; So strong was and is the impression, 
that, on visiting Rendlesham as archdeacon, when I was sixty 
years old, on going up to the rectory-house I asked especially to
see this dark closet.&nbsp; There it was, dark and unchanged 
since fifty-six years ago; and at the sight of it I had no 
comfortable recollection, nor have I now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the year 1814 was a great feast on the Green&mdash;a
rejoicing for the peace.&nbsp; One thing still sticks to my 
memory, and that is the figure of Mrs Sheming, a farmer&rsquo;s 
wife.&nbsp; She was a very large woman, and wore a tight-fitting 
white dress, with a blue ribbon round her waist, on which was 
printed &lsquo;Peace and Plenty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the year 1815 we spent the summer in London, in a 
house in Brunswick Square, which overlooked the grounds of the 
Foundling Hospital.&nbsp; Three events of that year have always 
remained impressed on my memory.&nbsp; The first was the death of
little Mary, our only sister.&nbsp; She must have been a 
strangely precocious child, since at barely three years old she 
could wellnigh read.&nbsp; My mother, <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>who died 
fifty-two years after in her eighty-third year, on each year when
Mary&rsquo;s death came round took out her clothes, kept so long,
and, after airing them, put them away in their own drawer.&nbsp; 
The second event, which I well remember, was being taken out to 
see the illuminations for the battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; I can 
perfectly remember the face of Somerset House, all ablaze with 
coloured lamps.&nbsp; The third event was the funeral of a poor 
girl named Elizabeth Fenning.&rdquo; <a name="citation11"></a><a 
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p>And there those childish reminiscences broke off&mdash;never 
to be resumed.&nbsp; But from recollections of my father&rsquo;s 
talk&mdash;and he loved to talk of the past&mdash;I will attempt 
to write what he himself might have written; no set biography, 
but just the old household tales.</p>
<p>After the visit to London the family lived a while at Wickham 
Market, where my father saw the long strings of tumbrils, laden 
with Waterloo wounded, on their way from Yarmouth to 
London.&nbsp; Then in 1818 they settled at Earl Soham, my 
grandfather having become rector of that parish and Monk 
Soham.&nbsp; His father, Robinson <!-- page 12--><a 
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Groome, the 
sea-captain, had purchased the advowson of Earl Soham from the 
Rev. Francis Capper (1735-1818), whose long tenure <a 
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12" 
class="citation">[12]</a> of his two conjoint livings was 
celebrated by the local epigrammatist:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Capper, they say, has bought a 
horse&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The pleasure of it bating&mdash;<br />
That man may surely keep a horse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who keeps a Groome in waiting.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was in the summer-house at Earl Soham that my father, a 
very small boy, read &lsquo;Gil Blas&rsquo; to the cook, Lois 
Dowsing, and the sweetheart she never married, a strapping 
sergeant of the Guards, who had fought at Waterloo.&nbsp; And it 
was climbing through the window of this summer-house that he tore
a big rent in his breeches (he had just been promoted to them), 
so was packed off to bed.&nbsp; That afternoon my grandfather and
grandmother were sitting in the summer-house, and she told him of
the mishap and its punishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stupid child!&rdquo; 
said my grandfather; <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>&ldquo;why, I could get through there
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; He tried, and he too tore his small-clothes,
but he was not sent to bed.</p>
<p>With his elder brother, John Hindes (afterwards Rector of Earl
Soham), my father went to school at Norwich under Valpy.&nbsp; 
The first time my grandfather drove them, a forty-mile drive; and
when they came in sight of the cathedral spire, he pulled up, and
they all three fell a-weeping.&nbsp; For my grandfather was a 
tender-hearted man, moved to tears by the Waverley novels.&nbsp; 
Of Valpy my father would tell how once he had flogged a day-boy, 
whose father came the next day to complain of his severity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Valpy, &ldquo;I flogged your son because 
he richly deserved it.&nbsp; If he again deserves it, I shall 
again flog him.&nbsp; And&rdquo;&mdash;rising&mdash;&ldquo;if you
come here, sir, interfering with my duty, sir, I shall flog 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The parent fled.</p>
<p>The following story I owe to an old schoolfellow of my 
father&rsquo;s, the Rev. William Drake.&nbsp; &ldquo;Among the 
lower boys,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;were a brother of mine, 
somewhat of a pickle, and a classmate of his, who in after years 
blossomed into a Ritualistic clergyman, and who was the son of a 
gentleman, living in the Lower Close, not remarkable for personal
beauty.&nbsp; One morning, as he was coming up the school, the 
sound of weeping reached old Valpy&rsquo;s ears: straightway he 
stopped to investigate whence it proceeded.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stand 
up, sir,&rsquo; he cried in a voice of thunder, for he hated <!--
page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>snivelling; &lsquo;what is the matter with 
you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Please, sir,&rsquo; came the answer, 
much interrupted by sobs and tears, &lsquo;Bob Drake says 
I&rsquo;m uglier than my father, and that my father is as ugly as
the Devil.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another old Norwich story may come in here, of two middle-aged
brothers, Jeremiah and Ozias, the sons of a dead composer, and 
themselves performers on the pianoforte.&nbsp; At a party one 
evening Jeremiah had just played something, when Ozias came up 
and asked him, &ldquo;Brother Jerry, what was that <i>beastly</i>
thing you were playing?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ozias, it was our 
father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was the reproachful answer; and Ozias 
burst into tears.</p>

<p>When my father went up to Cambridge, his father went with him,
and introduced him to divers old dons, one of whom offered him 
this sage advice, &ldquo;Stick to your quadratics, young 
man.&nbsp; <i>I</i> got my fellowship through my 
quadratics.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another, the mathematical lecturer at 
Peterhouse, was a Suffolk man, and spoke broad Suffolk.&nbsp; One
day he was lecturing on mechanics, and had arranged from the 
lecture-room ceiling a system of pulleys, which he proceeded to 
explain,&mdash;&ldquo;Yeou see, I pull this string; it will turn 
this small wheel, and then the next wheel, and then the next, and
then will raise that heavy weight at the end.&rdquo;&nbsp; He 
pulled&mdash;nothing happened.&nbsp; He pulled again&mdash;still 
no result.&nbsp; &ldquo;At least ta should,&rdquo; he 
remarked.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>Music engrossed, I fancy, a good deal of my 
father&rsquo;s time at Cambridge.&nbsp; He saw much of Mrs Frere 
of Downing, a pupil of a pupil of Handel&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Of her he
has written in the Preface to FitzGerald&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Letters.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was a member of the well-known 
&ldquo;Camus&rdquo;; and it was he (so the late Sir George Paget 
informed my doctor-brother) who settled the dispute as to 
precedence between vocalists and instrumentalists with the apt 
quotation, &ldquo;The singers go before, the minstrels follow 
after.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was an instrumentalist himself, his 
instrument the &rsquo;cello; and there was a story how he, the 
future Master of Trinity, and some brother musicians were 
proctorised one night, as they were returning from a festive 
meeting, each man performing on his several instrument.</p>
<p>He was an attendant at the debates at the Cambridge Union, 
<i>e.g.</i>, at the one when the question debated was, 
&ldquo;Will Mr Coleridge&rsquo;s poem of &lsquo;The Ancient 
Mariner&rsquo; or Mr Martin&rsquo;s Act tend most to prevent 
cruelty to animals?&rdquo;&nbsp; The voting was, for Mr Martin 5,
for Mr Coleridge 47; and &ldquo;only two&rdquo; says a note 
written by my father in 1877, &ldquo;of the seven who took part 
in the debate are now living&mdash;Lord Houghton and the Dean of 
Lincoln.&nbsp; How many still remember kind and civil Baxter, the
harness-maker opposite Trinity; and how many of them ever heard 
him sing his famous song of &lsquo;Poor Old Horse&rsquo;?&nbsp; 
Yet for <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>pathos, and, unhappily in some cases,
for truth, it may well rank even with &lsquo;The Ancient 
Mariner.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Baxter used to sing it so 
tenderly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, of the Earl Soham life&mdash;a life not unlike that
of &ldquo;Raveloe&rdquo;&mdash;my father had much to tell.&nbsp; 
There was the Book Club, with its meetings at the 
&ldquo;Falcon,&rdquo; where, in the words of a local diarist, 
&ldquo;a dozen honest gentlemen dined merrily.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
were the heavy dinner-parties at my grandfather&rsquo;s, the 
regulation allowance of port a bottle per man, but more <i>ad 
libitum</i>.&nbsp; And there was the yearly &ldquo;Soham 
Fair,&rdquo; on July 12, when my grandfather kept open house for 
the parsons or other gentry and their womankind, who flocked in 
from miles around.&nbsp; On one such occasion my father had to 
squire a new-comer about the fair.&nbsp; The wife of a retired 
City alderman, she was enormously stout, and had chosen to appear
in a low dress.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Hillo, bor! what are yeou 
a-dewin&rsquo; with the Fat Woman?&rdquo;&mdash;one can imagine 
the delicate raillery.)</p>
<p>A well-known Earl-Sohamite was old Mr P---, who stuttered and 
was certainly eccentric.&nbsp; In summer-time he loved to catch 
small &ldquo;freshers&rdquo; (young frogs), and let them hop down
his throat, when he would stroke his stomach, observing, 
&ldquo;B-b-b-b-eautifully cool.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a staunch 
believer in the claims of the &ldquo;Princess Olive.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
17</span>She used to stay with him, and he always addressed her 
as &ldquo;Your Royal Highness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, there was Dr 
Belman.&nbsp; He was playing whist one evening with a maiden lady
for partner.&nbsp; She trumped his best card, and, at the end of 
the hand, he asked her the reason why.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Dr 
Belman&rdquo; (smilingly), &ldquo;I judged it 
judicious.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Judicious</i>!&nbsp; <span 
class="smcap">Judicious</span>!!&nbsp; JUDICIOUS!!!&nbsp; <i>You 
old fool</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; She never again touched a card.&nbsp; 
Was it the same maiden lady who was the strong believer in 
hom&oelig;opathy, and who one day took five globules of aconite 
in mistake for three?&nbsp; Frightened, she sent off for her 
hom&oelig;opathic adviser&mdash;he was from home.&nbsp; So, for 
want of a better, she called in old Dr Belman.&nbsp; He came, 
looked grave, shook his head, said if people would meddle with 
dangerous drugs they must take the consequences.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But, madam,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I will die with 
you;&rdquo; and, lifting the bottle of the fatal globules, 
swallowed its whole contents. <a name="citation17"></a><a 
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>To the days of my father&rsquo;s first curacy belongs the 
story of the old woman at Tannington, who fell ill one <!-- page 
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>winter when the snow was on the ground.&nbsp; She got 
worse and worse, and sent for Dr Mayhew, who questioned her as to
the cause of her illness.&nbsp; Something she said made him think
that the fault must lie with either her kettle or her tea-pot, as
she seemed, by her account, to get worse every time she drank any
tea.&nbsp; So he examined the kettle, turned it upside down, and 
then, in old Betty&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;Out drop a big 
t&ouml;ad.&nbsp; He tarned the kittle up, and out ta fell 
flop.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some days before she had &ldquo;deeved&rdquo; 
her kettle into the snow instead of filling it at the pump, and 
had then got the toad in it, which had thus been slowly simmering
into toad-broth.&nbsp; At Tannington also they came to my father 
to ask him to let them have the church Bible and the church 
key.&nbsp; The key was to be spun round on the Bible, and if it 
had pointed at a certain old woman who was suspected of being a 
witch, they would have certainly ducked her.</p>
<p>A score of old faded letters, close-written and crossed, are 
lying before me: my father wrote them in 1835 to his father, 
mother, and brother from Brussels, Mainz, Leipzig, Dresden, 
Prague, Munich, &amp;c.&nbsp; At Frankfurt he dined with the 
Rothschilds, and sat next the baroness, &ldquo;who in face and 
figure was very like Mrs Cook, and who spoke little English, but 
that little much to the purpose.&nbsp; For one dish I must eat 
because &lsquo;dis is <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Germany,&rsquo; and another because 
&lsquo;dis is England,&rsquo; placing at the word a large slice 
of roast-beef on my plate.&nbsp; The dinner began at half-past 
two, and lasted three mortal hours, during the first of which I 
ate because I was hungry, during the second out of politeness, 
and during the third out of sheer desperation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then 
there is a descent into a silver-mine with the present Lord 
Wemyss (better known as Lord Elcho), a gruesome execution of 
three murderers, and a good deal besides of some 
interest,&mdash;but the interest is not of Suffolk.</p>
<p>During his six years&rsquo; Dorset curacy my father was 
elected mayor of the little borough of Corfe Castle; and it was 
in Dorset, on 1st February 1843, that he married my mother, Mary 
Jackson (1815-93), the youngest daughter of the Rev. James 
Leonard Jackson, rector of Swanage, and of Louisa Decima Hyde 
Wollaston.&nbsp; Her father, my grandfather, was a great taker of
snuff; and one blustery day he was walking upon the cliffs when 
his hat blew off.&nbsp; He chased it and chased it over two or 
three fields until at last he got it in the angle of two stone 
walls.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aha! my friend, I think I have you 
now,&rdquo; said my grandfather, and proceeded to take a 
leisurely pinch of snuff, when a puff of wind came and blew the 
hat far out to sea.&nbsp; There are many more Dorsetshire stories
that recur to my memory; but neither here is the interest <!-- 
page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>of Suffolk.&nbsp; So to Suffolk we will come back, like 
my father in 1845, in which year he succeeded his father as 
rector of Monk Soham.</p>
<p>Monk Soham is a straggling parish of 1600 acres and 400 
inhabitants. <a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20" 
class="citation">[20]</a>&nbsp; It lies remote to-day, as it lay 
remote in pre-Reformation times, when it was a cell of St 
Edmundsbury, whither refractory monks were sent for 
rustication.&nbsp; Hence its name (the &ldquo;south village of 
the monks&rdquo;); and hence, too, the fish-ponds for Lenten 
fare, in the rectory gardens.&nbsp; Three of them enclose the 
orchard, which is planted quincunx-wise, with yew hedge and 
grass-walk all round it.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Archdeacon&rsquo;s 
Walk&rdquo; that grass-walk should be named, for my father paced 
it morning after morning.&nbsp; The pike and roach would plash 
among the reeds and water-lilies; and &ldquo;Fish, fish, do your 
duty,&rdquo; my father would say to them.&nbsp; Whereupon, he 
maintained, the fish always put out their noses and answered, 
&ldquo;If <i>you</i> do your duty, <i>we</i> do our 
duty,&rdquo;&mdash;words fully as applicable to parson as to 
sultan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p20.jpg">
<img alt="&ldquo;Fish, fish, do your duty.&rdquo;" 
src="images/p20.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The parish has no history, unless that a former rector, Thomas
Rogerson, was sequestrated as a royalist in 1642, and next year 
his wife and children were turned out of doors by the 
Puritans.&nbsp; &ldquo;After which,&rdquo; Walker tells us, <!-- 
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>&ldquo;Mr Rogerson lived with a Country-man in a very 
mean Cottage upon a Heath, for some years, and in a very low and 
miserable Condition.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if Monk Soham has no 
history, its church, St Peter&rsquo;s, is striking even among 
Suffolk churches, for the size of the chancel, the great 
traceried east window, and the font sculptured with the Seven 
Sacraments.&nbsp; The churchyard is pretty with trees and 
shrubs&mdash;those four yews by the gates a present from 
FitzGerald; and the rectory, half a mile off, is almost hidden by
oaks, elms, beeches, and limes, all of my father&rsquo;s and 
grandfather&rsquo;s planting.&nbsp; Else the parish soon will be 
treeless.&nbsp; It was not so when my father first came to 
it.&nbsp; Where now there is one huge field, there then would be 
five or six, not a few of them meadows, and each with pleasant 
hedgerows.&nbsp; There were two &ldquo;Greens&rdquo; 
then&mdash;one has many years since been enclosed; and there was 
not a &ldquo;made&rdquo; road in the entire parish&mdash;only 
grassy lanes, with gates at intervals.&nbsp; &ldquo;High 
farming&rdquo; has wrought great changes, not always to the 
profit of our farmers, whose moated homesteads hereabouts bear 
old-world names&mdash;Woodcroft Hall, Blood Hall, Flemings Hall, 
Crows Hall, Windwhistle Hall, and suchlike.&nbsp; &ldquo;High 
farming,&rdquo; moreover, has swallowed up most of the smaller 
holdings.&nbsp; Fifty years ago there were ten or a dozen farms 
in Monk Soham, each farm with its <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>resident 
tenant; now the number is reduced to less than half.&nbsp; It 
seems a pity, for a twofold reason: first, because the 
farm-labourer thus loses all chance of advancement; and secondly,
because the English yeoman will be soon as extinct as the 
bustard.</p>
<p>Tom Pepper was the last of our Monk Soham yeomen&mdash;a man, 
said my father, of the stuff that furnished Cromwell with his 
Ironsides.&nbsp; He was a strong Dissenter; but they were none 
the worse friends for that, not even though Tom, holding forth in
his Little Bethel, might sometimes denounce the corruptions of 
the Establishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;The clargy,&rdquo; he once 
declared, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re here, and they ain&rsquo;t here; 
they&rsquo;re like pigs in the garden, and yeou can&rsquo;t git 
&rsquo;em out.&rdquo;&nbsp; On which an old woman, a member of 
the flock, sprang up and cried, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, 
Brother Pepper, kitch &rsquo;em by the fifth buttonhole!&rdquo; 
<a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22" 
class="citation">[22]</a>&nbsp; Tom went once to hear Gavazzi 
lecture at Debenham, and next day my father asked him how he 
liked it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thowt I 
should ha&rsquo; beared that chap they call <i>Jerry Baldry</i>, 
but I din&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Howsomdiver, this one that sp&#335;ok 
fare to laa it into th&rsquo; owd Pope good tidily.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Another time my father said something to <!-- page 23--><a 
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>him about the
Emperor of Russia.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rooshur,&rdquo; said Tom; 
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s that him yeou call Prooshur?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
yet again, when a concrete wall was built on to a neighbouring 
farm-building, Tom remarked contemptuously that he 
&ldquo;din&rsquo;t think much of them consecrated 
walls.&rdquo;&nbsp; Withal, what an honest, sensible soul it 
was!</p>
<p>Midway between the rectory and Tom Pepper&rsquo;s is the 
&ldquo;Guildhall,&rdquo; an ancient house, though probably far 
less ancient than its name.&nbsp; It is parish property, and for 
years has served as an almshouse for ten or a dozen old 
people.&nbsp; My father used to read the Bible to them, and there
was a black cat once which would jump on to his knees, so at last
it was shut up in a cupboard.&nbsp; The top of this cupboard, 
however, above the door, was separated from the room only by a 
piece of pasted paper; and through this paper the cat&rsquo;s 
head suddenly emerged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cat, you bitch!&rdquo; said 
old Mrs Wilding, and my father could read no more.&nbsp; Nay, his
father (then in his last illness) laughed too when he heard the 
story.</p>
<p>The average age of those old Guildhall people must have been 
much over sixty, and some of them were nearly 
centenarians&mdash;Charity Herring, who was always setting fire 
to her bed with a worn-out warming-pan, and James Burrows, of 
whom my father made this jotting in one of his note-books: 
&ldquo;In the year 1853 I buried James <!-- page 24--><a 
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Burrows of 
this parish at the reputed age of one hundred years.&nbsp; 
Probably he was nearly, if not altogether that age.&nbsp; Talking
with him a few years before his death, I asked if his father had 
lived to be an old man, and he said that he had.&nbsp; I asked 
him then about his grandfather, and his answer was that he had 
lived to be a &lsquo;wonnerful owd man.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do 
you remember your grandfather?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Right well: I 
was a big bor when he died.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Did he use to 
tell you of things which he remembered?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, 
he was wery fond of talking about &rsquo;em: he used to say he 
could remember the Dutch king coming over.&rsquo;&nbsp; James 
Burrows could not read or write, nor his father probably before 
him: so that this statement must have been based on purely 
traditional grounds.&nbsp; Assume he was born in 1755 he would 
have been a &lsquo;big bor,&rsquo; fifteen years old, in 1770; 
and assume that his grandfather died in 1770 aged ninety-six, 
this would make him to have been born in 1675, fourteen or 
fifteen years before William of Orange landed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there were Tom and Susan Kemp.&nbsp; He came from 
somewhere in Norfolk, the scene, I remember, of the &lsquo;Babes 
in the Wood,&rsquo; and he wore the only smock-frock in the 
parish, where the ruling fashion was 
&ldquo;thunder-and-lightning&rdquo; sleeve-waistcoats.&nbsp; 
Susan&rsquo;s Sunday dress was a clean lilac print gown, made 
very <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>short, so as to show white stockings and boots with 
cloth tops.&nbsp; Over the dress was pinned a little black shawl,
and her bonnet was unusually large, of black velvet or silk, with
a great white frill inside it.&nbsp; She was troubled at times 
with a mysterious complaint called &ldquo;the wind,&rdquo; which 
she thus described, her finger tracing the course it followed 
within her: &ldquo;That fare to go round and round, and then out 
ta come a-raspin&rsquo; and a-roarin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another
of her ailments was swelled ankles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Mr 
Groome!&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;if yeou could but see my 
poare legs, yeou&rsquo;d niver forget &rsquo;em;&rdquo; and then,
if not stopped, she would proceed to pull up her short gown and 
show them.&nbsp; If my father had been out visiting more than to 
her seemed wise, she would, when he told her where he had been 
to, say: &ldquo;Ah! there yeou go a-rattakin&rsquo; about, and 
when yeou dew come home yeou&rsquo;ve a cowd, I&rsquo;ll be 
bound,&rdquo; which often enough was the case.&nbsp; 
Susan&rsquo;s contempt was great for poor folks dressing up their
children smartly; and she would say with withering scorn, 
&ldquo;What do har child want with all them 
wandykes?&rdquo;&mdash;<i>vandykes</i> being lace trimmings of 
any sort.&nbsp; Was it of spoilt children that she spoke as 
&ldquo;hectorin&rsquo; and bullockin&rsquo; 
about&rdquo;?&mdash;certainly it was of one of us, a late riser, 
that she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d soon out-of-bed har if I lived 
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
26</span>Susan&rsquo;s treatment of Harry Collins, a crazy man 
subject to fits, was wise and kind.&nbsp; Till Harry came to live
with the Kemps, he had been kept in bed to save trouble.&nbsp; 
Susan would have no more of bed for him than for ordinary folks, 
but sent him on many errands and kept him in excellent 
order.&nbsp; Her commands to him usually began with, 
&ldquo;Co&rsquo;, Henry, be stirrin&rsquo;;&rdquo; and he stood 
in wholesome awe of her, and obeyed her like a child.&nbsp; His 
fits were curious, for &ldquo;one minute he&rsquo;d be 
cussin&rsquo; and swearin&rsquo;, and the next fall 
a-prayin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once, too, he &ldquo;leapt out of 
the winder like a roebuck.&rdquo;&nbsp; Blind James Seaman, the 
other occupant of Susan&rsquo;s back-room, came of good old 
yeoman ancestry.&nbsp; He wore a long blue coat with brass 
buttons; and his favourite seat was the sunny bank near our front
gate.</p>
<p>In the room over Susan Kemp&rsquo;s lived Will Ruffles and his
wife, a very faithful old couple.&nbsp; The wife failed 
first.&nbsp; She had hurt herself a good deal with a fall down 
the rickety stairs.&nbsp; Will saw to her to the last, and 
watched carefully over her.&nbsp; The schoolmistress then, a Miss
Hindmarsh, took a great liking for the old man; and a friend of 
hers, a widow lady in London, though she had never seen him, made
him a regular weekly allowance to the end of his life&mdash;two 
shillings, half-a-crown, and sometimes more.&nbsp; This gave Will
many little comforts.&nbsp; Once <!-- page 27--><a 
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>when my 
sister took him his allowance, he told her how, when he was a 
young man, a Gipsy woman told him he should be better off at the 
end of his life than at the beginning; and &ldquo;she sp&#335;ok 
truth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but how she knew it I coon&rsquo;t 
s&auml;a.&rdquo;&nbsp; Will suffered at times from rheumatism, 
and had great faith in some particular green herb pills, which 
were to be bought only at one particular shop in Ipswich.&nbsp; 
My sister was once deputed to buy him a box of these pills, and 
he told her afterwards, &ldquo;Them there pills did me a lot of 
good, and that show what f&#335;oks s&auml;a about rheumatics 
bein&rsquo; in the boones ain&rsquo;t trew, for how could them 
there pills &rsquo;a got into the boones?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was 
very fond of my father, whom he liked to joke with him.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Mr Groome,&rdquo; he once said, &ldquo;dew mob me 
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will, like many other old people in the parish, believed in 
witchcraft,&mdash;was himself, indeed, a &ldquo;wise man&rdquo; 
of a kind.&nbsp; My father once told him about a woman who had 
fits.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; old Will said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ve 
fallen into bad hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you 
mean?&rdquo; asked my father; and then Will said that years 
before in Monk Soham there was a woman took bad just like this 
one, and &ldquo;there wern&rsquo;t but me and John Abbott in the 
place could git her right.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What did you 
do?&rdquo; said my father.&nbsp; &ldquo;We two, John and I, sat 
by a clear fire; and we had to bile <!-- page 28--><a 
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>some of the 
clippins of the woman&rsquo;s nails and some of her hair; and 
when ta biled&rdquo;&mdash;he paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;What 
happened?&rdquo; asked my father; &ldquo;did you hear 
anything?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear anything!&nbsp; I should think
we did.&nbsp; When ta biled, we h&rsquo;ard a loud shrike 
a-roarin&rsquo; up the chimley; and yeou may depind upon it, she 
warn&rsquo;t niver bad no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once my father showed Will a <i>silhouette</i> of his father, 
old Mr Groome of Earl Soham, a portly gentleman, dressed in the 
old-fashioned style.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ruffles, who is this?&rdquo; he
asked, knowing that Will had known his father well, and thinking 
he would recognise it.&nbsp; After looking at it carefully for 
some time, Will said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s yar son, the 
sailor.&rdquo;&nbsp; My eldest brother at that time might be 
something over twenty, and bore not the faintest resemblance to 
our grandfather; still, Will knew that he had been much abroad, 
and fancied a tropical sun might have blackened him.</p>
<p>By his own accounts, Will&rsquo;s feats of strength as a 
younger man, in the way of reaping, mowing, &amp;c., were 
remarkable; and there was one great story, with much in it about 
&ldquo;goolden guineas,&rdquo; of the wonderful sale of corn that
he effected for one of his masters.&nbsp; At the rectory 
gatherings on Christmas night Will was one of the principal 
singers, his <i>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> &ldquo;Oh! silver 
[query <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 29</span><i>Sylvia</i>] is a charming 
thing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Helmingham Wolunteers.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
That famous corps was raised by Lord Dysart to repel 
&ldquo;Bony&rsquo;s&rdquo; threatened invasion; its drummer was 
John Noble, afterwards the wheelwright in Monk Soham.&nbsp; Once 
after drill Lord Dysart said to him: &ldquo;You played that very 
well, John Noble;&rdquo; and &ldquo;I know&rsquo;t, my lord, I 
know&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was John&rsquo;s answer&mdash;an answer that
has passed into a Suffolk proverb, &ldquo;I know&rsquo;t, my 
lord, I know&rsquo;t, as said John Noble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Curtis was quite a character&mdash;a little woman, with 
sharp brown eyes that took in everything.&nbsp; Her tongue was 
smooth, her words were soft, and yet she could say bitter 
things.&nbsp; She had had a large family, who married and settled
in different parts.&nbsp; One son had gone to New 
Zealand&mdash;&ldquo;a country, Dr Fletcher tell me, dear Miss, 
as is outside the frame of the earth, and where the sun go round 
t&rsquo;other way.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was for one of her sons, when 
he was ill, that my mother sent a dose of castor-oil; and next 
day the boy sent to ask for &ldquo;some more of Madam 
Groome&rsquo;s nice gravy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another boy, Ephraim, 
once behaved so badly in church that my father had to stop in his
sermon and tell Mrs Curtis to take her son out.&nbsp; This she 
did; and from the pulpit my father saw her driving the 
unfortunate Ephraim before her with her umbrella, banging him 
with it first on one side and <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>then on the 
other.&nbsp; Mrs Curtis it was who prescribed the honey-plaster 
for a sore throat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Put on a honey-plaster, neighbour
dear; that will draw the misery out of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs 
Curtis it was who, having quarrelled with another neighbour, came
to my father to relate her wrongs: &ldquo;Me a poor lone widow 
woman, and she ha&rsquo; got a father to protect 
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; The said father was old James Burrows, already 
spoken of, who was over ninety, and had long been bedridden.</p>
<p>Mrs Mullinger was a strange old woman.&nbsp; People said she 
had an evil eye; and if she took a dislike to any one and looked 
evilly at their pigs, then the pigs would fall ill and die.&nbsp;
Also, when she lived next door to another cottage, with only a 
wall dividing the two chimneys, if old Mrs Mullinger sat by her 
chimney in a bad temper, no one on the other side could light a 
fire, try as they might.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be Smith and her husband Sam lived in one of the 
downstair rooms.&nbsp; At one time of her life Ph&oelig;be kept a
little dame&rsquo;s school on the Green.&nbsp; One class of her 
children, who were reading the Miracles, were called 
&ldquo;Little Miracles&rdquo;; and whenever my father went in, 
&ldquo;Little Miracles&rdquo; were called up by that name to read
to him.&nbsp; Old Ph&oelig;be had intelligence above the common; 
she read her Bible much, and thought over it.&nbsp; She was fond,
too, <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>of having my sister read hymns to her, and would often 
lift her hands in admiration at any passage she particularly 
liked.&nbsp; She commended a cotton dress my sister had on one 
day when she went to see her&mdash;a blue Oxford shirting, 
trimmed with a darker shade.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a nice solemn 
dress,&rdquo; she said, as she lifted a piece to examine it more 
closely; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing flummocky about 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the other Guildhall people were old Mrs 
&ldquo;Ratty&rdquo; Kemp, widow of the Rat-catcher; <a 
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31" 
class="citation">[31]</a> old one-eyed Mrs Bond, and her deaf son
John; old Mrs Wright, a great smoker; and Mrs Burrows, a 
soldier&rsquo;s widow, our only Irishwoman, from whom Monk Soham 
conceived no favourable opinion of the Sister Isle.&nbsp; Of 
people outside the Guildhall I will mention but one, James 
Wilding, a splendid type of the Suffolk labourer.&nbsp; He was a 
big strong man, whose strength served him one very ill 
turn.&nbsp; He was out one day after a hare, and a farm-bailiff, 
meeting him, tried to take his gun; James resisted, and snapped 
the man&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; For this he got a year in Ipswich 
jail, where, however, he learnt to read, and formed a strong 
attachment for the chaplain, Mr Daniel.&nbsp; Afterwards, 
whenever any of us were driving over to Ipswich, and James met 
us, he would always say, &ldquo;If yeou see Mr <!-- page 32--><a 
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Daniel, dew 
yeou give him my love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finally, an emigration agent 
got hold of James, and induced him to emigrate, with his wife, 
his large family, and his old one-legged mother, to somewhere 
near New Orleans.&nbsp; &ldquo;How are you going, Wilding?&rdquo;
asked my father a few days before they started.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
don&rsquo;t fare to know rightly,&rdquo; was the answer; 
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to sleep the fust night at 
Debenham&rdquo; (a village four miles off), &ldquo;and 
that&rsquo;ll kinder break the jarney.&rdquo;&nbsp; They went, 
but the Southern States and the negroes were not at all to their 
liking, and the last thing heard of them was they had moved to 
Canada.</p>
<p>So James Wilding is gone, and the others are all of them dead;
but some stories still remain to be cleared off.&nbsp; There was 
the old farmer at the tithe dinner, who, on having some 
bread-sauce handed to him, extracted a great &ldquo;dollop&rdquo;
on the top of his knife, tasted it, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t 
ch&uuml;se none.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was the other who remarked of
a particular pudding, that he &ldquo;could rise in the night-time
and eat it&rdquo;; and there was the third, who, supposing he 
should get but one plate, shovelled his fish-bones under the 
table.&nbsp; There was the boy in Monk Soham school who, asked to
define an earthquake, said, &ldquo;It is when the &rsquo;arth 
shug itself, and swallow up the &rsquo;arth&rdquo;; and there was
his schoolmate, who said that &ldquo;America was discovered by 
British Columbia.&rdquo;&nbsp; There <!-- page 33--><a 
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>was old 
Mullinger of Earl Soham, who thought it &ldquo;wrong of 
f&#335;oks to go up in a ballune, as that fare <a 
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33" 
class="citation">[33]</a> so bumptious to the 
Almighty.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was the actual balloon, which had 
gone up somewhere in the West of England, and which came down in 
(I think) the neighbouring parish of Bedfield.&nbsp; As it 
floated over Monk Soham, the aeronaut shouted, &ldquo;Where am 
I?&rdquo; to some harvesters, who, standing in a row, their 
forefingers pointed at him, shouted back, &ldquo;Yeou&rsquo;re in
a ballune, bor.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was old X., who, whenever my 
father visited him, would grumble, talk scandal, and abuse all 
his neighbours, always, however, winding up piously with 
&ldquo;But &rsquo;tis well.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was the boy whom 
my father put in the stocks, but who escaped by unlacing his 
&ldquo;high-lows,&rdquo; and so withdrawing his feet.&nbsp; There
was the clergyman, preaching in a strange church, who asked to 
have a glass of water in the pulpit, and who, after the sermon, 
remarked to the clerk in the vestry, &ldquo;That might have been 
gin-and-water, John, for all the people could tell.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
And, taking the duty again there next Sunday, he found to his 
horror it <i>was</i> gin-and-water: &ldquo;I took the hint, 
sir&mdash;I took the hint,&rdquo; quoth John, from the 
clerk&rsquo;s desk below.&nbsp; There was the Monk Soham woman 
who, when she got a letter from her son in Hull, told the curate 
that &ldquo;that did give me a tarn at fust, <!-- page 34--><a 
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>for I thought
that come from the hot place.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was another Monk
Soham woman who told my sister one day that she had been reading 
in the Bible &ldquo;about that there gal Haggar,&rdquo; and who, 
after discussing the story of Hagar, went on, &ldquo;When that 
gal grew up she went and preached to some fooks in a city that 
were livin&rsquo; bad lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; My sister did not know 
about this, so inquired where she had found it, and she turned to
the Book of the Prophet Haggai&mdash;Hagar and Haggai to her were
one and the same.&nbsp; There was the manufacturer of artificial 
manures who set up a carriage and crest; and a friend asked my 
father what the motto would be.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mente et manu 
res,&rdquo; was the ready answer.&nbsp; There was the concert at 
Ipswich, where the chairman, a very precise young clergyman, 
announced that &ldquo;the Rev. Robert Groome will sing (ahem!) 
&lsquo;<i>Thomas</i> Bowling.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The song was a 
failure; my father each time was so sorely tempted to adopt the 
new version.&nbsp; There was the old woman whom my father heard 
warning her daughter, about to travel for the first time by rail,
&ldquo;Whativer yeou do, my dear, mind yeou don&rsquo;t sit nigh 
the biler.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was the old maiden lady, who every 
morning after breakfast read an Ode of Horace; and the other 
maiden lady, a kinswoman of my father&rsquo;s, who practised her 
scales regularly long after she was sixty.&nbsp; <!-- page 
35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>She, 
if you crushed her in an argument, in turn crushed you with, 
&ldquo;<i>Well</i>, <i>there it is</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was 
much besides, but memory fails, and space.</p>
<p>From country clergyman to country archdeacon may seem no 
startling transition; yet it meant a great change in my 
father&rsquo;s tranquil life.&nbsp; For one thing it took him 
twice a-year up to London, to Convocation; and in London he met 
with many old friends and new.&nbsp; Then there were frequent 
outings to Norwich, and the annual visitations and the 
Charge.&nbsp; On the first day of his first visitation, at Eye, 
there was the usual luncheon, and the usual very small modicum of
wine.&nbsp; Lunch over, the Rev. Richard Cobbold, the author of 
&lsquo;Margaret Catchpole,&rsquo; proposed my father&rsquo;s 
health in a fervid oration, which wound up thus: 
&ldquo;Gentlemen, I call upon you to drink the health of our new 
archdeacon,&mdash;to drink it, gentlemen, in flowing 
bumpers.&rdquo;&nbsp; It sounded glorious, but the decanters were
empty; and my father had to order (and pay for) two dozen of 
sherry.&nbsp; At an Ipswich visitation there was the customary 
roll-call of the clergy, among whom was a new-comer, a Scotchman,
Mr Colquhoun.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr&mdash;, Mr&mdash;,&rdquo; faltered 
the apparitor, coming unexpectedly on this uncouth name; suddenly
he rose a-tiptoe and to the emergency,&mdash;&ldquo;Mr 
Cockahoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of the deaneries my father found a churchyard <!-- page
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
36</span>partly sown with wheat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really, Mr 
Z---,&rdquo; he said to the incumbent, &ldquo;I must say I 
don&rsquo;t like to see this.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the old 
churchwarden chimed in, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I s&auml;a tew, 
Mr Archdeacon; I s&auml;a to our parson, &lsquo;Yeou go 
whatin&rsquo; it and whatin&rsquo; it, why don&rsquo;t yeou tater
it?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This found its way into 
&lsquo;Punch,&rsquo; with a capital drawing by Charles Keene, 
whom my father met often at FitzGerald&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But there 
is another unrecorded story of an Irish clergyman, the Rev. 
&ldquo;Lucius O&rsquo;Grady.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had quarrelled with 
one of his churchwardens, whose name I forget; the other&rsquo;s 
was Waller.&nbsp; So my father went over to arbitrate between the
disputants, and Mr &ldquo;O&rsquo;Grady&rdquo; concluded an 
impassioned statement of his wrongs with &ldquo;Voil&agrave; 
tout, Mr Archdeacon, voil&agrave; tout.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Waller tew,&rdquo; quoth churchwarden No. 1; &ldquo;what 
ha&rsquo; <i>he</i> to dew with it?&rdquo;&nbsp; And there was 
the visit to that woful church, damp, rotten, ruinous.&nbsp; The 
inspection over, the rector said to my father, &ldquo;Now, Mr 
Archdeacon, that we&rsquo;ve done the old church, you must come 
and see my new stables.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said my 
father, &ldquo;when your church is in decent order, I shall be 
happy to see your new stables.&rdquo;&nbsp; And &ldquo;the next 
time,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;I really could ask to see 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two London reminiscences, and I have done.&nbsp; A <!-- page 
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>former Monk Soham schoolmistress had married the usher 
of the Marlborough Street police court.&nbsp; My father went to 
see them, and as he was coming away, an officious Irishman opened
the cab-door for him, with &ldquo;Good luck to your Rivirince, 
and did they let you off aizy?&rdquo;&nbsp; And once my father 
was waiting on one of the many platforms of Clapham Junction, 
when suddenly a fashionably dressed lady dropped on her knees 
before him, exclaiming, &ldquo;Your blessing, holy 
Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; cried my 
father,&mdash;then added quietly, &ldquo;and you too, my dear 
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So at last I come to my father&rsquo;s own Suffolk 
stories.&nbsp; In 1877-78 I made my first venture in letters as 
editor for the &lsquo;Ipswich Journal&rsquo; of a series of 
&ldquo;Suffolk Notes and Queries.&rdquo;&nbsp; They ran through 
fifty-four numbers, my own set of which is, I fancy, almost 
unique.&nbsp; I had a goodly list of contributors&mdash;all 
friends of my father&rsquo;s&mdash;as Mr FitzGerald, Mr Donne, 
Captain Brooke of Ufford, Mr Chappell, Mr Aldis Wright, Bishop 
Ryle, and Professors Earle, Cowell, and Skeat.&nbsp; Of them I 
was duly proud; still, my father and I wrote, between us, 
two-thirds of the whole.&nbsp; He was the &ldquo;Habitans in 
Alto&rdquo; (<i>High</i> Suffolk, forsooth), <i>alias</i> 
&ldquo;Rector,&rdquo; <i>alias</i> &ldquo;Philologus,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Hippicus,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;how we used to laugh at 
<!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>those aliases.&nbsp; Among his contributions were three 
papers on the rare old library of Helmingham Hall (Lord 
Tollemache&rsquo;s), four on Samuel Ward, the Puritan preacher of
Ipswich, three on Suffolk minstrelsy, and these sketches written 
in the Suffolk dialect.&nbsp; Of that dialect my father was a 
past-master; once and once only did I know him nonplussed by a 
Suffolk phrase.&nbsp; This was in the school at Monk Soham, where
a small boy one day had been put in the corner.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
for?&rdquo; asked my father; and a chorus of voices answered, 
&ldquo;He ha&rsquo; bin tittymatauterin,&rdquo; which meant, it 
seems, playing at see-saw.&nbsp; I retain, of course, my 
father&rsquo;s own spelling; but he always himself maintained 
that to reproduce the dialect phonetically is next to 
impossible&mdash;that, for instance, there is a delicate 
<i>nuance</i> in the Suffolk pronunciation of <i>dog</i>, only 
faintly suggested by <i>dawg</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">J. D.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>My father used to repeat one stanza of an old song; I wonder 
whether the remainder still exists in any living memory.&nbsp; 
That one stanza ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The roaring boys of Pakefield,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, how they all do thrive!<br />
They had but one poor parson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And him they buried alive.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether the prosperity of Pakefield was to be dated or derived
from the fact of their burying their &ldquo;one poor 
parson&rdquo; is a matter of dangerous speculation, and had 
better be left in safe obscurity; else other places might be 
tempted to make trial of the successful plan.&nbsp; But can any 
one send a copy of the whole song?</p>
<p>From the same authority I give a stanza of another 
song:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>&ldquo;The cackling old hen she began
to collogue,<br />
Says she unto the fox, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a stinking old 
rogue;<br />
Your scent it is so strong, I do wish you&rsquo;d keep 
away;&rsquo;<br />
The cackling old hen she began for to say.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tune, as I still remember it, is as fine as the 
words&mdash;for fine they certainly are, as an honest expression 
of opinion, capable of a large application to other than 
foxes.</p>
<p>I cannot vouch for a like antiquity for the following 
sea-verses; but they are so good that I venture to append them to
their more ancient brethren:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And now we haul to the &lsquo;Dog and 
Bell,&rsquo;<br />
Where there&rsquo;s good liquor for to sell;<br />
In come old Archer with a smile,<br />
Saying, &lsquo;Drink, my lads, &rsquo;tis worth your 
while.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ah! but when our money&rsquo;s all gone and spent,<br />
And none to be borrowed nor none to be lent;<br />
In comes old Archer with a frown,<br />
Saying, &lsquo;Get up, Jack, let John sit down.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas, poor Jack! and John Countryman too, when the like result
arrives.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">J. D.</p>
<p>Fifteen years after my father had penned this note, and more 
than two years after his death, I received from a <!-- page 
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>West 
Indian reader of &lsquo;Maga,&rsquo; who had heard it sung by a 
naval officer (since deceased), the following version of the

laughed more or less, all but one, the Rev. &ldquo;Hervey Du

convinced that their guest must be in a fit, she at last arose, 
and listened outside his door.&nbsp; A fit he was in&mdash;sure

<h3>IV.&nbsp; CAPTAIN WARD.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That 
piece of song,<br />
That old and antique song we heard last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;&lsquo;Twelfth Night,&rsquo; II. iv.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This old song was lately taken down from the lips of an old 
Suffolk (Monk Soham) labourer, who has known it and sung it since
he was a boy.&nbsp; The song is of much <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>repute in the
parish where he lives, and may possibly be already in 
print.&nbsp; At all events it is a genuine &ldquo;old and 
antique&rdquo; song, whose hero may have been one of the sea 
captains or rovers who continued their privateering in the 
Spanish Main and elsewhere, and upon all comers, long after all 
licence from the Crown had ceased.&nbsp; The Rainbow was the name
of one of the ships which formed the English fleet when they 
defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, and she was re-commissioned,
apparently about 1618.&nbsp; The two verses in brackets are from 
the version of another labourer in my parish, who also furnished 
some minor <i>vari&aelig; lectiones</i>, as &ldquo;robber&rdquo; 
for &ldquo;rover,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blake&rdquo; for 
&ldquo;Wake,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

<p>Come, all ye valiant soldiers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That march to follow the drum,<br />
Let us go meet with Captain Ward<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When on the sea he come.</p>
<p>He is as big a rover<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As ever you did hear,<br />
Yeou hain&rsquo;t h&rsquo;ard of such a rover<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For many a hundred year.</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Indies to the West,<br />
Well loaded with silks and satins<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And welwets of the best.</p>
<p>Who should they meet but Captain Ward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It being a bad meeting,<br />
He robb&egrave;d them of all their wealth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid them go tell the King.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;Go ye home, go ye home,&rdquo; says Captain Ward,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And tell your King from me,<br />
If he reign King of the countrie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be King at Sea.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>Away went these three gallant ships,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sailing down of the main,<br />
Telling to the King the news<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Ward at sea would reign.</p>
<p>The King he did prepare a ship,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A ship of gallant fame,<br />
She&rsquo;s called the gallant Rainbow&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Din&rsquo;t yeou niver hear her name?</p>
<p><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
48</span>She was as well purw&#299;ded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As e&rsquo;er a ship could be,<br />
She had three hundred men on board<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bear her company.</p>
<p>Oh then the gallant Rainbow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sailed where the rover laid;<br />
&ldquo;Where is the captain of your ship?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gallant Rainbow said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here am I,&rdquo; says Captain Ward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My name I never deny;<br />
But if you be the King&rsquo;s good ship,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;re welcome to pass by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am one of the King&rsquo;s good ships,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I am to your great grief,<br />
Whilst here I understand you lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Playing the rogue and thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! here am I,&rdquo; says Captain Ward;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I value you not one pin;<br />
If you are bright brass without,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am true steel within.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; They did begin to fight,<br />
And so they did continue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till nine or ten at night.</p>
<p>[Says Captain Ward unto his men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My boys, what shall we do?<br />
We have not got one shot on board,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall get overthrow.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight you on, fight you on,&rdquo; says Captain 
Ward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your sport will pleasure be,<br />
And if you fight for a month or more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your master I will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh! then the gallant Rainbow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went raging down of the main,<br />
Saying, &ldquo;There lay proud Ward at sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there he must remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Wake and Captain Drake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And good Lord Henerie,<br />
If I had one of them alive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;d bring proud Ward to me.&rdquo;</p>

4, fol. 202, by Clarke Thackeray and Passinger; two in the 
Bayford, [643, m. 9 / 65] and [643, m. 10 / 78].&nbsp; These are 
by W. Onbey, and the second in white letter.&nbsp; Further, two 
Aldermary Church Yard editions in Rox. v. 3, folios 652 and 
861.&nbsp; The ballad has an Elizabethan cut about it, beginning,
&ldquo;Strike up, you lusty Gallants.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I remember 
rightly, Ward was a famous pirate of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, 
about the same time as Dansekar the Dutchman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went down myself to Magdalene, and saw the copy in 
the Pepysian Library there.&nbsp; It is entirely different from 
that in the &lsquo;Suffolk N. and Q.,&rsquo; though at the same 
time there are <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>slight resemblances in 
expression.&nbsp; As ballads they are quite distinct.&nbsp; I 
suppose the other copies to which Mr Chappell refers are like the
Pepysian, which begins as he says, &lsquo;Strike up, ye lusty 
Gallants.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>V.<br />
A SOVEREIGN REMEDY.</h3>
<p>Not many years since, not far from Ipswich, some practical 
agriculturists met&mdash;as, for all I know, they may meet 
now&mdash;at a Farmers&rsquo; Club to discuss such questions as 
bear practically upon their business and interests.&nbsp; One 
evening the subject for discussion was, &ldquo;How to cure hot 
yards,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, yards where the manure has become so 
heated as to be hurtful to the cattle&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; Many 
remedies were suggested, some no doubt well worth trying, others 
dealing too much maybe in small-talk of acids and alkalis.&nbsp; 
None of the party was satisfied that a cure had been found which 
stood the test of general experience.&nbsp; Then they asked an 
elderly farmer, who had preserved a profound silence through all 
the discussion, what he would recommend.&nbsp; His answer was 
very true and to the point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he 
said, &ldquo;yeou shu&rsquo;nt have let it got so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost my fust wife thatty-three years ago.&nbsp; She 
left me with six bors and Susan.&nbsp; She was the owdest of them
all, tarned sixteen when her mother died.&nbsp; She was a fine 
jolly gal, with lots of sperit.&nbsp; I coon&rsquo;t be alluz at

I wanted some one to look arter her and the bors.&nbsp; Gals want
a mother more than bors.&nbsp; So arter a year I married my 
second wife, and a rale good wife she ha&rsquo; bin to me.&nbsp; 
But Susan coon&rsquo;t git on with her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d dew <a 
name="citation52d"></a><a href="#footnote52d" 
class="citation">[52d]</a> what she was towd, but 
&rsquo;twarn&rsquo;t done pleasant, and <!-- page 53--><a

sp&#335;ok she sp&#335;ok <i>so</i> short.&nbsp; My wife was 
werry patient with her; but dew all she could, she nivver could 
git on with Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d a married sister in London, whue cum down to 
see us at Whissuntide.&nbsp; She see how things fared, and she 
s&auml;a to me, &lsquo;John,&rsquo; sez she, &lsquo;dew yeou let 
Susan go back with me, and I&rsquo;ll git her a good place and 
see arter her.&rsquo;&nbsp; So &rsquo;twas sattled.&nbsp; Susan 
was all for goin&rsquo;, and when she went she kiss&rsquo;t me 
and all the bors, but she nivver sed nawthin&rsquo; to my wife, 
&rsquo;cept just &lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo;&nbsp; She fared to git a
nice quite <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53" 
class="citation">[53]</a> place; but then my sister left London, 
and Susan&rsquo;s missus died, and so she had to git a place 
where she could.&nbsp; So she got a place where they took in 
lodgers, and Susan and her missus did all the cookin&rsquo; and 
waitin&rsquo; between &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Susan sed arterwards that 
&rsquo;twarn&rsquo;t what she had to dew, but the runnin&rsquo; 
up-stairs; that&rsquo;s what killt her.&nbsp; There was one owd 
gentleman, who lived at the top of the house.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d 
ring his bell, and if she din&rsquo;t go di-reckly, he&rsquo;d 
ring and ring agen, fit to bring the house down.&nbsp; One daa he
rung three times, but Susan was set fast, and coon&rsquo;t go; 
and when she did, he sp&#335;ok so sharp, that it wh&#335;lly 
upset her, and she dropt down o&rsquo; the floor all in a 
faint.&nbsp; He hollered out at the top o&rsquo; the stairs; and 
sum o&rsquo; the f&#335;oks cum runnin&rsquo; up to see what was 
the <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
54</span>matter.&nbsp; Arter a bit she cum round, and they got 
her to bed; but she was so bad that they had to send for the 
doctor.&nbsp; The owd gentleman was so wexed, he sed he&rsquo;d 
p&auml;a for the doctor as long as he could; but when the doctor 
sed she was breedin&rsquo; a faver, nawthing would satisfy her 
missus but to send her to the horspital, while she could go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she went into the horspital, and l&auml;a five weeks
and din&rsquo;t know nobody.&nbsp; Last she begun to mend, and 
she sed that the f&#335;oks there were werry kind.&nbsp; She had 
a bed to herself in a big room with nigh twenty others.&nbsp; 
Ivry d&auml;a the doctor cum round, and sp&#335;ok to &rsquo;em 
all in tarn.&nbsp; He was an owdish gentleman, and sum young uns 
cum round with him.&nbsp; One mornin&rsquo; he s&auml;a to Susan,
&lsquo;Well, my dear,&rsquo; sez he, &lsquo;how do yeou feel 
to-day?&rsquo;&nbsp; She s&auml;a, &lsquo;Kind o&rsquo; 
middlin&rsquo;, sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; She towd me that one o&rsquo; 
the young gentlemen sort o&rsquo; laffed when he h&rsquo;ard her,
and stopped behind and saa to her, &lsquo;Do yeou cum out 
o&rsquo; Suffolk?&rsquo;&nbsp; She s&auml;a, &lsquo;Yes; what, do
yeou know me?&rsquo;&nbsp; She was <i>so</i> pleased!&nbsp; He 
axed her where she cum from, and when she towd him, he s&auml;a, 
&lsquo;I know the clargyman of the parish.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;d a rose in his button-hole, and he took it out and gov 
it her, and he s&auml;a, &lsquo;Yeou&rsquo;ll like to hev it, for
that cum up from Suffolk this mornin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&nbsp; Poor 
mor, she was <i>so</i> pleased!&nbsp; Well, arter a bit she got 
better, and the doctor s&auml;a, &lsquo;My <!-- page 55--><a

must go and git nussed at home.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll dew more for 
yeou than all the doctors&rsquo; stuff here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She han&rsquo;t no money left to p&auml;a for her 
jarney.&nbsp; But the young gentleman made a gatherin&rsquo; for 
her, and when the nuss went with her to the station, he holp her 
into the cab, and gov her the money.&nbsp; Whue he was she 
din&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t now, but I alluz s&auml;a, 
&lsquo;God bless him for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One mornin&rsquo; the owd parson&mdash;he was yar 
father&mdash;sent for me, and he s&auml;a, &lsquo;John,&rsquo; 
sez he, &lsquo;I ha&rsquo; had a letter to say that Susan

Susan coon&rsquo;t write, so we&rsquo;d nivver h&rsquo;ard,

felt!&nbsp; Well, I went and met her.&nbsp; O lawk, a lawk! how 
bad she did look!&nbsp; I got her home about five, and my wife 
had got a good fire, and ivrything nice for her, but, poor mor! 
she was wh&#335;lly beat.&nbsp; She coon&rsquo;t eat 
nawthin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Arter a bit, she tuk off her bonnet, and 
then I see she han&rsquo;t no hair, &rsquo;cept a werry 
little.&nbsp; That wh&#335;lly beat me, she used to hev such nice
hair.&nbsp; Well, we got her to bed, and for a whole week she 
coon&rsquo;t howd up at all.&nbsp; Then she fare to git better, 
and cum down-stairs, and sot by the fire, and begun to pick a 
little.&nbsp; <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span

cum, sometimes better and sometimes wuss.&nbsp; But she spook 
werry little, and din&rsquo;t seem to git on no better with my 
wife.&nbsp; Yar father used to cum and see her and read to 
her.&nbsp; He was werry fond of her, for he had knowed her ivver 
sin&rsquo; she was born.&nbsp; But she got waker and waker, and 
at last she coon&rsquo;t howd up no longer, but took wh&#335;lly 
to her bed.&nbsp; How my wife did wait upon her!&nbsp; 
She&rsquo;d try and &rsquo;tice her to ate suffen, <a

noticed, she seem werry glad to see yar father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day I&rsquo;d cum home arly; I&rsquo;d made one 
jarney. <a name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b"

There I see my wife l&auml;ad outside the bed close to Susan; 
Susan was kind o&rsquo; strokin&rsquo; her face, and I 
h&rsquo;ard her s&auml;a, &lsquo;Kiss me, mother dear; 
yeou&rsquo;re a good mother to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; They din&rsquo;t 
see me, so I crep&rsquo; down-stairs, but it made me werry 
comforble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s bed l&auml;a close to the wall, so that

we went di-reckly.&nbsp; There she l&auml;a&mdash;I can see her

&ldquo;MASTER CHARLEY.&rdquo;</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">A Suffolk Labourer&rsquo;s 
Story</span>.</p>
<p>The Owd Master at the Hall had two children&mdash;Mr James and
Miss Mary.&nbsp; Mr James was ivver so much owder than Miss 
Mary.&nbsp; She come kind o&rsquo; unexpected like, and she 
warn&rsquo;t but a little thing when she lost her mother.&nbsp; 
When she got owd enough Owd Master sent her to a young 
ladies&rsquo; skule.&nbsp; She was there a soot o&rsquo; years, 
and when she come to st&auml;a at home, she <i>was</i> such a 
pretty young lady, <i>that</i> she was.&nbsp; She was werry fond 
of cumpany, but there warn&rsquo;t the lissest bit wrong about 
her.&nbsp; There was a young gentleman, from the sh&#275;res, who
lived at a farm in the next parish, where he was come to larn 
farmin&rsquo;.&nbsp; He was werry fond of her, and though his own
folks din&rsquo;t like it, it was all sattled that he was soon to
marry her.&nbsp; Then he hear&rsquo;d suffen about her, which 
warn&rsquo;t a bit true, and he went aw&auml;a, and was persuaded
to marry somebody else.&nbsp; Miss Mary took on bad about it, but
that warn&rsquo;t the wust of it.&nbsp; She had a baby before 
long, and he was the father on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>O lawk, a lawk! how the Owd Master did break out <!-- page 
61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>when 
he hear&rsquo;d of it!&nbsp; My mother lived close by, and nussed
poor Miss Mary, so I&rsquo;ve h&rsquo;ard all about it.&nbsp; He 
woun&rsquo;t let the child stop in the house, but sent it 
aw&auml;a to a house three miles off, where the woman had lost 
her child.&nbsp; But when Miss Mary got about, the woman used to 
bring the baby&mdash;he was &ldquo;Master Charley&rdquo;&mdash;to
my mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; One d&auml;a, when she went down, my 
mother towd her that he warn&rsquo;t well; so off she went to see
him.&nbsp; When she got home she was late, and the owd man was 
kep&rsquo; waitin&rsquo; for his dinner.&nbsp; As soon as he see 
her, he roared out, &ldquo;What! hev yeou bin to see yar 
bastard?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O father,&rdquo; says she, 
&ldquo;yeou shoun&rsquo;t s&auml;a so.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Shoun&rsquo;t s&auml;a so,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;shoun&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; I can s&auml;a wuss than 
that.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he called her a bad name.&nbsp; She 
got up, nivver said a wadd, but walked straight out of the front 
door.&nbsp; They din&rsquo;t take much notiz at fust, but when 
she din&rsquo;t come back, they got scared, and looked for her 
all about; and at last they found her in the m&#335;ot, at the 
bottom of the orchard.</p>
<p>O lawk, a lawk!</p>
<p>The Owd Master nivver could howd up arter that.&nbsp; 
&rsquo;Fore that, if he was put out, yeou could hear &rsquo;im 
all over the farm, a-cussin&rsquo; and swearin&rsquo;.&nbsp; He 
werry seldom sp&#335;ok to anybody now, but he was alluz about 
arly and late; n&#335;thin&rsquo; seemed to tire him.&nbsp; 
&rsquo;Fore that he nivver went to <!-- page 62--><a 
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>ch&#259;rch; 
now he went reg&rsquo;ler.&nbsp; But he wud s&auml;a sumtimes, 
comin&rsquo; out, &ldquo;Parson&rsquo;s a fule.&rdquo;&nbsp; But 
if anybody was ill, he bod &rsquo;em go up to the Hall and ax for
suffen. <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62" 
class="citation">[62]</a>&nbsp; There was young Farmer 
Whoo&rsquo;s wife was werry bad, and the doctor s&auml;a that 
what she wanted was London poort.&nbsp; So he sent my father to 
the marchant at Ipswich, to bring back four dozen.&nbsp; Arter 
dark he was to lave it at the house, but not to knock.&nbsp; They
nivver knew where ta come from till arter he died.&nbsp; But he 
fare to get waker, and to stupe more ivry year.</p>
<p>Yeou ax me about &ldquo;Master Charley.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, he 
growed up such a pretty bor.&nbsp; He lived along with my mother 
for the most part, and Mr James was so fond of him.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;d come down, and pl&auml;a and talk to him the hour 
togither, and Master Charley would foller &rsquo;im about like a 
little dawg.</p>
<p>One d&auml;a they was togither, and Owd Master met 
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; &ldquo;James,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what bor is
that alluz follerin&rsquo; yeou about?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said, 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mary&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;&nbsp; The owd man 
t&#259;rned round as if he&rsquo;d bin shot, and went home all 
himpin&rsquo; along.&nbsp; Folks heared him s&auml;a, 
&ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s child!&nbsp; Lord!&nbsp; Lord!&rdquo;&nbsp; 
When he got in, he sot down, and nivver sp&#335;ok a w&#259;dd, 
&rsquo;cept now and then, &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s child!&nbsp; 
Lord!&nbsp; Lord!&rdquo;&nbsp; He coun&rsquo;t ate no dinner; but
he towd &rsquo;em to <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span

he s&auml;a to her, &ldquo;Missus, yeou must git me to 
bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there he l&auml;a all night, nivver 
sl&#257;pin&rsquo; a bit, but goin&rsquo; on s&auml;ain, 
&ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s child!&nbsp; <i>Lord</i>!&nbsp; 
<i>Lord</i>!&rdquo; quite solemn like.&nbsp; Sumtimes he&rsquo;d 
s&auml;a, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bin a bad un in my time, I 
hev.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next mornin&rsquo; Mr James sent for the doctor.&nbsp; But 
when he come, Owd Master said, &ldquo;Yeou can do nothin&rsquo; 
for me; I oon&rsquo;t take none o&rsquo; yar stuff.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
No more he would.&nbsp; Then Mr James s&auml;a, &ldquo;Would yeou
like to see the parson?&rdquo;&nbsp; He din&rsquo;t s&auml;a 
n&#335;thin&rsquo; for some time, then he said, &ldquo;Yeou may 
send for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the parson come&mdash;and he was 
a nice quite <a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63" 
class="citation">[63]</a> owd gentleman, we were werry fond of 
him&mdash;he went up and st&auml;a&rsquo;d some time; but he 
nivver said n&#335;thin&rsquo; when he come down.&nbsp; 
Howsomdiver, Owd Master l&auml;a more quiter arter that, and when
they axed him to take his med&rsquo;cin he took it.&nbsp; Then he
slep&rsquo; for some hours, and when he woke up he called out 
quite clear, &ldquo;James.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when Mr James come, 
he s&auml;a to him, &ldquo;James,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;I 
ha&rsquo; left ivrything to yeou; do yeou see that Mary hev her 
share.&rdquo;&nbsp; You notiz, he din&rsquo;t s&auml;a, 
&ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s child,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Mary hev her 
share.&rdquo;&nbsp; Arter a little while he said, &ldquo;James, I
should like to see the little chap.&rdquo;&nbsp; He warn&rsquo;t 
far off, and my mother made him tidy, and brushed his hair and 
parted it.&nbsp; Then she <!-- page 64--><a

and put him close to the bed.&nbsp; Owd Master bod &rsquo;em put 
the curtain back, and he l&auml;a and looked at Master 
Charley.&nbsp; And then he said, quite slow and tendersome, 
&ldquo;Yeou&rsquo;re a&rsquo;most as pritty as your mother was,

<p>Them was the last words he ivver sp&#335;ok.</p>

<p>My earliest recollections of FitzGerald go back to thirty-six 
years.&nbsp; He and my father were old friends and 
neighbours&mdash;in East Suffolk, where neighbours are few, and 
fourteen miles counts for nothing.&nbsp; They never were great 
correspondents, for what they had to say to one another they said
mostly by word of mouth.&nbsp; So there were notes, but no 
letters; and the notes have nearly all perished.&nbsp; In the 
summer of 1859 we were staying at Aldeburgh, a favourite place 
with my father, as the home of his forefathers.&nbsp; They were 
sea-folk; and Robinson Groome, my great-grandfather, was owner of
the Unity lugger, on which the poet Crabbe went up to 
London.&nbsp; When his son, my grandfather, was about to take 
orders, he expressed a timid hope that the bishop <!-- page 
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>would
deem him a proper candidate.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who the devil in 
hell,&rdquo; cried Robinson Groome, &ldquo;should he ordain if he
doesn&rsquo;t ordain you, my dear?&rdquo; <a 
name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68" 
class="citation">[68]</a>&nbsp; This I have heard my father tell 
FitzGerald, as also of his &ldquo;Aunt Peggy and Aunt D.&rdquo; 
(<i>i.e.</i>, Deborah), who, if ever Crabbe was mentioned in 
their hearing, always smoothed their black mittens and 
remarked&mdash;&ldquo;<i>We</i> never thought much of Mr 
Crabbe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our house was Clare Cottage, where FitzGerald himself lodged 
long afterwards.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two little rooms, enough for me; a 
poor civil woman pleased to have me in them.&rdquo;&nbsp; It 
fronts the sea, and is (or was) a small two-storeyed house, with 
a patch of grass before it, a summer-house, and a big white 
figurehead, belike of the shipwrecked Clare.&nbsp; So over the 
garden-gate FitzGerald leant one June morning, and asked me, a 
boy of eight, was my father at home.&nbsp; I remember him dimly 
then as a tall sea-browned man, who took us boys out for several 
sails, on the first of which I and a brother were both of us 
woefully sea-sick.&nbsp; Afterwards I remember picnics down the 
Deben river, and visits to him at Woodbridge, first in his <!-- 
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
69</span>lodgings on the Market Hill over Berry the 
gunsmith&rsquo;s, and then at his own house, Little Grange.&nbsp;
The last was in May 1883.&nbsp; My father and I had been spending
a few days with Captain Brooke of Ufford, the possessor of one of
the finest private libraries in England. <a 
name="citation69"></a><a href="#footnote69" 
class="citation">[69]</a>&nbsp; From Ufford we drove on to 
Woodbridge, and passed some pleasant hours with FitzGerald.&nbsp;
We walked down to the riverside, and sat on a bench at the foot 
of the lime-tree walk.&nbsp; There was a small boy, I remember, 
wading among the ooze; and FitzGerald, calling him to him, 
said&mdash;&ldquo;Little boy, did you never hear tell of the fate
of the Master of Ravenswood?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he told him 
the story.&nbsp; At dinner there was much talk, as always, of 
many things, old and new, but chiefly old; and at nine we started
on our homeward drive.&nbsp; Within a month I heard that 
FitzGerald was dead.</p>
<p>From my own recollections, then, of FitzGerald himself, but 
still more of my father&rsquo;s frequent talk of him, from some 
notes and fragments that have escaped hebdomadal burnings, from a
visit that I paid to Woodbridge in the summer of 1889, and from 
reminiscences and unpublished <!-- page 70--><a 
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>letters 
furnished by friends of FitzGerald, I purpose to weave a 
patchwork article, which shall in some ways supplement Mr Aldis 
Wright&rsquo;s edition of his Letters. <a 
name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70" 
class="citation">[70]</a>&nbsp; Those letters surely will take a 
high place in literature, on their own merits, quite apart from 
the interest that attaches to the translator of Omar 
Khayy&aacute;m, to the friend of Thackeray, Tennyson, and 
Carlyle.&nbsp; Here and there I may cite them; but whoso will 
know FitzGerald must go to the fountain-head.&nbsp; And yet that 
the letters by themselves may convey a false impression of the 
man is evident from several articles on them&mdash;the best and 
worst Mr Gosse&rsquo;s in the &lsquo;Fortnightly&rsquo; (July 
1889).&nbsp; Mr Gosse sums him up in the statement that 
&ldquo;his time, when the roses were not being pruned, and when 
he was not making discreet journeys in uneventful directions, was
divided between music, which greatly occupied his younger 
thought, and literature, which slowly, but more and more 
exclusively, engaged his attention.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is truth 
in the statement; still this pruner of roses, who of rose-pruning
<!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>knew absolutely nothing, was one who best loved the sea 
when the sea was rough, who always put into port of a Sunday that
his men might &ldquo;get their hot dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was 
one who would give his friend of the best&mdash;oysters, maybe, 
and audit ale, which &ldquo;dear old Thompson&rdquo; used to send
him from Trinity&mdash;and himself the while would pace up and 
down the room, munching apple or turnip, and drinking long 
draughts of milk.&nbsp; He was a man of marvellous simplicity of 
life and matchless charity: hereon I will quote a letter of 
Professor Cowell&rsquo;s, who did, if any one, know FitzGerald 
well:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was no Sybarite.&nbsp; There was a vein 
of strong scorn of all self-indulgence in him, which was very 
different.&nbsp; He was, of course, very much of a recluse, with 
a vein of misanthropy towards men in the abstract, joined to a 
tender-hearted sympathy for the actual men and women around 
him.&nbsp; He was the very reverse of Carlyle&rsquo;s description
of the sentimental philanthropist, who loves man in the abstract,
but is intolerant of &lsquo;Jack and Tom, who have wills of their
own.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FitzGerald&rsquo;s charities are probably forgotten, unless by
the recipients; and how many of them must be dead, old soldiers 
as they mostly were, and suchlike!&nbsp; But this I have heard, 
that one man borrowed &pound;200 of him.&nbsp; Three times he 
regularly paid the interest, and the third time FitzGerald put 
his note of hand in the fire, just saying he thought that would 
do.&nbsp; His simplicity dated from very <!-- page 72--><a 
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>early 
times.&nbsp; For when he was at Trinity, his mother called on him
in her coach-and-four, and sent a gyp to ask him to step down to 
the college-gate, but he could not come&mdash;his only pair of 
shoes was at the cobbler&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And down to the last he 
was always perfectly careless as to dress.&nbsp; I can see him 
now, walking down into Woodbridge, with an old Inverness cape, 
double-breasted, flowered satin waistcoat, slippers on feet, and 
a handkerchief, very likely, tied over his hat.&nbsp; Yet one 
always recognised in him the Hidalgo.&nbsp; Never was there a 
more perfect gentleman.&nbsp; His courtesy came out even in his 
rebukes.&nbsp; A lady one day was sitting in a Woodbridge shop, 
gossiping to a friend about the eccentricities of the Squire of 
Boulge, when a gentleman, who was sitting with his back to them, 
turned round, and, gravely bowing, gravely said, &ldquo;Madam, he
is my brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were eccentric, certainly, the 
FitzGeralds.&nbsp; FitzGerald himself remarked of the family: 
&ldquo;We are all mad, but with this difference&mdash;<i>I</i> 
know that I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; And of that same brother he once 
wrote to my father:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>: <i>Dec.</i> 2/66.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Groome</span>,&mdash;&ldquo;At 
least for what I know&rdquo; (as old Isaac Clarke used to say), I
shall be at home next week as well as this.&nbsp; How could you 
<i>expect</i> my Brother <!-- page 73--><a 
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>3 
times?&nbsp; You, as well as others, should really (for his 
Benefit, as well as your own) either leave it all to Chance, or 
appoint <i>one</i> Day, and then decline any further 
Negotiation.&nbsp; This would really spare poor John an immense 
deal of (in sober Truth) &ldquo;Taking the Lord&rsquo;s Name in 
vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; I mean his eternal <i>D.V.</i>, which, 
translated, only means, &ldquo;If <i>I</i> happen to be in the 
Humour.&rdquo;&nbsp; You must know that the feeling of being 
<i>bound</i> to an Engagement is the very thing that makes him 
wish to break it.&nbsp; Spedding once told me this was rather my 
case.&nbsp; I believe it, and am therefore shy of ever making an 
engagement.&nbsp; <i>O si sic omnia</i>!&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">E. F. G.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of another brother, Peter, the Catholic brother, as John was 
the Protestant one, he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>, <i>Tuesday</i>, <i>Feb.</i> 16, 
1875.</p>
<p>You may have heard that my Brother Peter is dead, of 
Bronchitis, at Bournemouth.&nbsp; He was taken seriously ill on 
Thursday last, and died on Saturday without pain; and I am told 
that his last murmured words were <i>my</i> name&mdash;thrice 
repeated.&nbsp; A more amiable Gentleman did not live, with 
something <i>helpless</i> about him&mdash;what the Irish call an 
&ldquo;Innocent man&rdquo;&mdash;which mixed up Compassion with 
Regard, and made it perhaps stronger. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>Many odd tales were current in Woodbridge about 
FitzGerald himself.&nbsp; How once, for example, he sailed over 
to Holland, meaning to look upon Paul Potter&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Bull,&rdquo; but how, on arriving there, he found a 
favourable homeward breeze, and so sailed home.&nbsp; How, too, 
he took a ticket for Edinburgh, but at Newcastle found a train on
the point of starting for London, and, thinking it a pity to lose
the chance, returned thereby.&nbsp; Both stories must be myths, 
for we learn from his letters that in 1861 he really did spend 
two days in Holland, and in 1874 other two in Scotland.&nbsp; 
Still, I fancy both stories emanated from FitzGerald, for all 
Woodbridge united could not have hit upon Paul Potter&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Bull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Except in February 1867, when he was strongly opposed to Lord 
Rendlesham&rsquo;s election, he took no active part in 
politics.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t write politics&mdash;I agree 
with you beforehand,&rdquo; is a postscript (1852) to Frederic 
Tennyson; and in a letter from Mr William Bodham Donne to my 
father occurs this passage: &ldquo;E. F. G. informs me that he 
gave his landlord instructions in case any one called about his 
vote to say that Mr F. would <i>not</i> vote, advised every one 
to do the same, and let the rotten matter bust 
itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it certainly stands in the letter, which 
bears date 29th October 1868; but, according to Mr Mowbray Donne,
&ldquo;the phrase was <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>rather: &lsquo;Let the rotten old 
ship go to pieces of itself.&rsquo;&nbsp; At least,&rdquo; he 
adds, &ldquo;so I have always heard it; and this suggests that 
once there was a galleon worth preserving, but that he would not 
patch up the old craft.&nbsp; He may have said both, of 
course.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anyhow, rightly or wrongly, FitzGerald was 
sorrowfully convinced that England&rsquo;s best day was over, and
that he, that any one, was powerless to arrest the inevitable 
doom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am quite assured that this Country is dying,
as other Countries die, as Trees die, atop first.&nbsp; The lower
limbs are making all haste to follow.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wrote thus 
in 1861, when the local squirearchy refused to interest itself in
the &ldquo;<i>manuring</i> and <i>skrimmaging</i>&rdquo; of the 
newly established rifle corps.&nbsp; And here are some more 
vaticinations of evil:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have long felt about England as you do, 
and even made up my mind to it, so as to sit comparatively, if 
ignobly, easy on that score.&nbsp; Sometimes I envy those who are
so old that the Curtain will probably fall on them before it does
on their Country.&nbsp; If one could save the Race, what a Cause 
it would be! not for one&rsquo;s own glory as a member of it, nor
even for its glory as a Nation: but because it is the only spot 
in Europe where Freedom keeps her place.&nbsp; Had I 
Alfred&rsquo;s voice, I would not have mumbled for years over In 
Memoriam and The Princess, but sung such strains as would have 
revived the 
&Mu;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&theta;&omega;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&chi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&alpha;&nu;&delta;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf; to guard the territory 
they had won.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
76</span>The curtain has fallen twelve years now on 
FitzGerald,&mdash;it is fifty-four years since he wrote those 
words: God send their dark forebodings may prove false!&nbsp; But
they clouded his life, and were partly the cause why, Ajax-like, 
he loitered in his tent.</p>
<p>His thoughts on religion he kept to himself.&nbsp; A letter of
June 1885 from the late Master of Trinity to my father opens 
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear 
Archdeacon</span>,&mdash;I ought to have thanked you ere this for
your letter, and the enclosed hymn, which we much admire, and 
cannot but be touched by. <a name="citation76"></a><a 
href="#footnote76" class="citation">[76]</a>&nbsp; The more 
perhaps as our dear dead friend seems to have felt its 
pathos.&nbsp; I have more to repent of than he had.&nbsp; Two of 
the purest-living men among my intimates, FitzGerald and 
Spedding, were prisoners in Doubting Castle all their lives, or 
at least the last half of them.&nbsp; This is to me a great 
problem,&mdash;not to be solved by the ordinary expedients, nor 
on this side the Veil, I think.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A former rector of Woodbridge, now many years dead, once 
called on FitzGerald to express his regret that he never saw him 
at church.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said FitzGerald, &ldquo;you 
might have conceived that a man has not come to my years of life 
without thinking much of these things.&nbsp; I believe I may say 
that I have reflected on them fully as much as yourself.&nbsp; 
You need not repeat this visit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certain <!-- page 
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>it is
that FitzGerald&rsquo;s was a most reverent mind, and I know that
the text on his grave was of his own choosing&mdash;&ldquo;It is 
He that hath made us, and not we ourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know, 
too, that sometimes he would sit and listen in a church porch 
while service was going on, and slip away unperceived before the 
people came out.&nbsp; Still, it seems to me beyond question that
his version of the &lsquo;Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t&rsquo; is an 
utterance of his soul&rsquo;s deepest doubts, and that hereafter 
it will come to be recognised as the highest expression of 
Agnosticism:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow,<br 
/>
And with mine own hand wrought to make it grow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And this was all the Harvest that I 
reap&rsquo;d&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;I came like Water, and like Wind I go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Into this Universe, and <i>Why</i> not knowing<br />
Nor <i>Whence</i>, like Water willy-nilly flowing;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,<br />
I know not <i>Whither</i>, willy-nilly blowing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yet to how many critics this has seemed but a poem of the 
wine-cup and roses!</p>
<p>FitzGerald proved a most kindly contributor to the series of 
&ldquo;Suffolk Notes and Queries&rdquo; that I edited for the 
&lsquo;Ipswich Journal&rsquo; in 1877-78.&nbsp; The following 
were some of his notes, all signed &ldquo;Effigy&rdquo;&mdash;a 
play on his initials:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Major Moor</i>, <i>David Hume</i>, <i>and the Royal 
George</i>.&mdash;In a review of Burton&rsquo;s Life of Hume, p. 
354 of the &lsquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine,&rsquo; April 1849, 
is the following quotation from the book, and the following note 
upon it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Page 452.&nbsp; &ldquo;Major M---, 
with whom I dined yesterday, said that he had frequently met 
David Hume at their military mess in Scotland, and in other 
parties.&nbsp; That he was very polite and pleasant, though 
thoughtful in company, generally reclining his head upon his 
hand, as if in study; from which he would suddenly 
recover,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; [Note by the Editor, John Mitford 
of Benhall.]&nbsp; We merely add that Major M--- was Major Moor, 
author of the Hindoo Pantheon, a very learned and amiable 
person.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>&ldquo;A very odd blunder for one distinguished Suffolk 
man to make of another, and so near a neighbour.&nbsp; For David 
Hume died in 1776, when Major Moor was about seven years old; by 
this token that (as he has told me) he saw the masts of the <span
class="smcap">Royal George</span> slope under water as she went 
down in 1782, while he was on board the transport that was to 
carry him to India, a cadet of thirteen years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly sixty years after this, Major Moor (as I also 
heard him relate) was among the usual company going over one of 
the Royal Palaces&mdash;Windsor, I think&mdash;when the cicerone 
pointed out a fragment of the Royal George&rsquo;s mast, 
whereupon one elderly gentleman of the party told them that 
<i>he</i> had witnessed the disaster; after which Major Moor 
capped the general amazement by informing the little party that 
they had two surviving witnesses of it among them that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Suffolk Minstrelsy</i>.&mdash;These fragments of a 
Suffolk Harvest-Home Song, remembered by an old Suffolk Divine, 
offer room for historical and lyrical conjecture.&nbsp; I think 
the song must consist of <i>tew</i> several fragments.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Row tu me, tow tu me,&rsquo; says 
He-ne-ry Burgin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Row tu me, row tu me, I prah;<br />
For I ha&rsquo; tarn&rsquo;d a Scotch robber across the salt 
seas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tu ma-i-nt&rsquo;n my tew brothers and 
me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And frigh-te-ned he were,<br />
For to see these bold Bri-tons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So active in war.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Limb</i>.&mdash;I find this word, whose derivation 
has troubled Suffolk vocabularies, quoted in its Suffolk sense 
from Tate Wilkinson, in &lsquo;Temple Bar Magazine&rsquo; for 
January 1876.&nbsp; Mrs White&mdash;an actress somewhere in the 
Shires,&mdash;she may have derived from Suffolk, 
however&mdash;addresses her daughter, Mrs Burden, in these words:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Maam, if you contradict me, 
I&rsquo;ll fell you at my feet, and trample over your corse, 
Maam, for you&rsquo;re a <i>limb</i>, Maam, your father on his 
deathbed told me you were a <i>limb</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
(<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Perhaps Mr White it was who derived from 
<i>us</i>.)&nbsp; And again when poor Mrs Burden asks what is 
meant by a <i>parenthesis</i>, her mother exclaims, &lsquo;Oh, 
what an infernal <i>limb</i> of an actress you&rsquo;ll make, not
to know the meaning <i>of prentice</i>, plural of 
<i>apprentices</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; Such is Tate&rsquo;s story if 
correctly quoted by &lsquo;Temple Bar.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not long ago 
I heard at Aldbro&rsquo;, &lsquo;My mother is a <i>limb</i> for 
salt pork.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Suffolk dialect was ever a pet hobby of 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For years he was meditating a new 
edition of Major Moor&rsquo;s &lsquo;Suffolk Words,&rsquo; but 
the question never was settled whether words of his own 
collecting were to be incorporated in the body of the work or 
relegated to <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>an appendix.&nbsp; So the notion 
remained a notion.&nbsp; Much to our loss, for myself I prefer 
his &lsquo;Sea-Words and Phrases along the Suffolk Coast&rsquo; 
(in the scarce &lsquo;East Anglian,&rsquo; 1868-69 <a 
name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81" 
class="citation">[81]</a>) to half his translations.&nbsp; For 
this &ldquo;poor old Lowestoft sea-slang,&rdquo; as FitzGerald 
slightingly calls it, illustrates both his strong love of the sea
and his own quaint lovable self.&nbsp; One turns over its pages 
idly, and lights on dozens of entries such as these:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Bark</span>.&mdash;&lsquo;The surf 
<i>bark</i> from the Nor&rsquo;ard;&rsquo; or, as was otherwise 
said to me, &lsquo;The sea aint lost his woice from the 
Nor&rsquo;ard yet,&rsquo;&mdash;a sign, by the way, that the wind
is to come from that quarter.&nbsp; A poetical word such as those
whose business is with the sea are apt to use.&nbsp; Listening 
one night to the sea some way inland, a sailor said to me, 
&lsquo;Yes, sir, the sea roar for the loss of the wind;&rsquo; 
which a landsman properly interpreted as meaning only that the 
sea made itself heard when the wind had subsided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Brustle</span>.&mdash;A compound of
<i>Bustle</i> and <i>Rustle</i>, I suppose.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, the
old girl <i>brustle</i> along like a 
Hedge-sparrow!&rsquo;&mdash;said of a round-bowed vessel 
spuffling through the water.&nbsp; I am told that, comparing 
little with great, the figure is not out of the way.&nbsp; 
Otherwise, <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>what should these ignorant seamen 
know of Hedge-sparrows?&nbsp; Some of them do, however; fond of 
birds, as of other pets&mdash;Children, cats, small 
dogs&mdash;anything in short considerably under the size 
of&mdash;a Bullock&mdash;and accustomed to birds-nesting over 
your cliff and about your lanes from childhood.&nbsp; A little 
while ago a party of Beechmen must needs have a day&rsquo;s 
frolic at the old sport; marched bodily into a neighbouring 
farmer&rsquo;s domain, ransacked the hedges, climbed the trees, 
coming down pretty figures, I was told, (in plainer language) 
with guernsey and breeches torn fore and aft; the farmer after 
them in a tearing rage, calling for his gun&mdash;&lsquo;They 
were Pirates&mdash;They were the Press-gang!&rsquo; and the boys 
in Blue going on with their game laughing.&nbsp; When they had 
got their fill of it, they adjourned to Oulton Boar for 
&lsquo;Half a pint&rsquo;; by-and-by in came the raging farmer 
for a like purpose; at first growling aloof; then warming towards
the good fellows, till&mdash;he joined their company, 
and&mdash;insisted on paying their shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cards</span>.&mdash;Though often 
carried on board to pass away the time at All-fours, Don, or 
Sir-wiser (<i>q.v.</i>), nevertheless regarded with some 
suspicion when business does not go right.&nbsp; A friend of mine
vowed that, if his ill-luck continued, over the cards should go; 
and <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>over they went.&nbsp; Opinions differ as to 
swearing.&nbsp; One Captain strictly forbade it on board his 
lugger; but he, also continuing to get no fish, called out, 
&lsquo;Swear away, lads, and see what that&rsquo;ll 
do.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps he only meant as M&eacute;nage&rsquo;s 
French Bishop did; who going one day to Court, his carriage stuck
fast in a slough.&nbsp; The Coachman swore; the Bishop, putting 
his head out of the window, bid him not do that; the Coachman 
declared that unless he did, his horses would never get the 
carriage out of the mud.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well then, says the Bishop,
just for this once then.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Egg-bound</span>.&mdash;Probably an
inland word; but it was only from one of the beach I heard 
it.&nbsp; He had a pair of&mdash;what does the reader 
think?&mdash;Turtle-doves in his net-loft, looking down so 
drolly&mdash;the delicate creatures&mdash;from their wicker cage 
on the rough work below, that I wondered what business they had 
there.&nbsp; But this truculent Salwager assured me seriously 
that he had &lsquo;doated on them,&rsquo; and promised me the 
first pair they should hatch.&nbsp; For a long while they had no 
family, so long &lsquo;<i>neutral</i>&rsquo; indeed as to cause 
grave doubts whether they were a pair at all.&nbsp; But at last 
one of them began to show signs of cradle-making, picking at some
hay stuffed into the wicker-bars to encourage them; and I was 
told that she was manifestly 
&lsquo;<i>egg-bound</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
84</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">New Moon</span>.&mdash;When 
first seen, be sure to turn your money over in your pocket by way
of making it grow there; provided always that you see her face to
face, not through a glass (window)&mdash;for, in that case, the 
charm works the wrong way.&nbsp; &lsquo;I see the little dear 
this evening, and give my money a twister; there wasn&rsquo;t 
much, but I roused her about.&rsquo;&nbsp; Where 
&lsquo;<i>her</i>&rsquo; means the Money, not the Moon.&nbsp; 
Every one knows of what gender all that is amiable becomes in the
Sailor&rsquo;s eyes: his Ship, of course&mdash;the &lsquo;Old 
Dear&rsquo;&mdash;the &lsquo;Old Girl&rsquo;&mdash;the &lsquo;Old
Beauty,&rsquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think the Sea is so 
familiarly addrest; <i>she</i> is almost too strong-minded, 
capricious, and terrible a Virago, and&mdash;he is wedded to her 
for better or worse.&nbsp; Yet I have heard the Weather (to whose
instigation so much of that Sea&rsquo;s ill-humours are due) 
spoken of by one coming up the hatchway, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see 
how <i>she</i> look now.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Moon is, of course, a 
Woman too; and as with the German, and, I believe, the ancient 
Oriental people, &lsquo;the blessed Sun himself a fair hot Wench 
in a flame-colour&rsquo;d taffeta,&rsquo; and so <i>she</i> 
rises, <i>she</i> sets, and <i>she</i> crosses the Line.&nbsp; So
the Timepiece that measures the hours of day and night.&nbsp; A 
Friend&rsquo;s Watch going wrong of late, I advised Regulating; 
but was gravely answer&rsquo;d that &lsquo;<i>She</i> was a 
foreigner, and he did not like meddling with 
<i>her</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same poor <!-- page 85--><a 
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>ignorant was 
looking with me one evening at your fine old church [Lowestoft] 
which sadly wanted regulating too: lying all along indeed like a 
huge stranded Ship, with one whole side battered open to the 
ribs, through which &lsquo;the Sea-wind sang shrill, 
chill&rsquo;; and he &lsquo;did not like seeing her so 
distress&rsquo;d&rsquo;; remembering boyish days, and her good 
old Vicar (of course I mean the <i>former</i> one: pious, 
charitable, venerable Francis Cunningham), and looking to lie 
under her walls, among his own people&mdash;&lsquo;if not,&rsquo;
as he said, &lsquo;<i>somewhere else</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some 
months after, seeing the Church with her southern side restored 
to the sun, the same speaker cried, &lsquo;Well done, Old 
Girl!&nbsp; Up, and crow again!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>FitzGerald&rsquo;s hesitancy about Major Moor&rsquo;s book was
typical of the man.&nbsp; I am assured by Mr John Loder of 
Woodbridge, who knew him well, that it was inordinately difficult
to get him to do anything.&nbsp; First he would be delighted with
the idea, and next he would raise up a hundred objections; then, 
maybe, he would again, and finally he wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The 
wonder then is, not that he published so little, but that he 
published so much; and to whom the credit thereof was largely due
is indicated in this passage from a letter of Mr W. B. 
Donne&rsquo;s, of date 25th March 1876.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>&ldquo;I am so delighted at the glory
E. F. G. has gained by his translation of the 
Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t of Omar Khayy&aacute;m.&nbsp; The 
&lsquo;Contemporary Review&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Spectator&rsquo;
newspaper!&nbsp; It is full time that Fitz should be disinterred,
and exhibited to the world as one of the most gifted of 
Britons.&nbsp; And Bernard Quaritch deserves a piece of plate or 
a statue for the way he has thrust the Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t to 
the front.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no understanding FitzGerald till one fully realises 
that vulgar ambition had absolutely no place in his nature.&nbsp;
Your ass in the lion&rsquo;s skin nowadays is the ass who fain 
would be lionised; and the modern version of the parable of the 
talents is too often the man who, untalented, tries to palm off 
Brummagem counterfeits.&nbsp; FitzGerald&rsquo;s fear was not 
that he would write worse than half his compeers, but that he 
might write as ill.&nbsp; &ldquo;This visionary 
inactivity,&rdquo; he tells John Allen, &ldquo;is better than the
mischievous activity of so many I see about me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He 
applied Malthus&rsquo;s teaching to literature; he was content so
long as he pleased the Tennysons, some half-dozen other friends, 
and himself, than whom no critic ever was more fastidious.&nbsp; 
And when one thinks of all the &ldquo;great poems&rdquo; that 
were published during his lifetime, and read and praised (more 
praised than read perhaps), and then forgotten, one wonders if, 
after all, he was so wholly wrong in that he read for profit and 
scribbled for amusement,&mdash;that he communed with his <!-- 
page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>own heart and was still.&nbsp; Besides, had he not 
&ldquo;awful examples&rdquo;?&nbsp; There was the Suffolk parson,
his contemporary, who announced at nineteen that he had read all 
Shakespeare and Milton, and did not see why he should not at any 
rate equal them.&nbsp; So he fell to work&mdash;his poems were a 
joy to FitzGerald.&nbsp; Then there was Bernard Barton.&nbsp; 
FitzGerald glances at his passion for publishing, his belief that
&ldquo;there could not be too much poetry abroad.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
And lastly there was Carlyle, half scornful of FitzGerald&rsquo;s
&ldquo;ultra modesty and innocent <i>far-niente</i> life,&rdquo; 
his own superhuman activity regarded meanwhile by FitzGerald with
a gentle half-pitying wonder, of which one catches a premonitory 
echo in this extract from a long letter <a 
name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87" 
class="citation">[87]</a> of Sir Frederick Pollock&rsquo;s to W. 
H. Thompson.&nbsp; It bears date 14th February 1840, two years 
before Carlyle and FitzGerald met:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Carlyle&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chartism&rsquo; has 
been much read.&nbsp; It has fine things in it, but nothing 
new.&nbsp; He is eminently a man of one idea, but then neither he
nor any one else knows exactly what that one is.&nbsp; So that by
dint of shifting it about to and fro, and, as you <!-- page 
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>observe, clothing his remarks in the safe obscurity of a
foreign language, he manages to produce a great impression.&nbsp;
Truly he is a trumpet that gives an uncertain sound, an 
instrument of no base metal, but played without book, whose 
compass is not ascertained, and continually failing from 
straining at too high a note.&nbsp; Spedding has not yet found 
him out; FitzGerald has, and we lamentably rejoice at our 
melancholy discovery.&nbsp; Never was there such a waste of Faith
as in that man.&nbsp; He is ever preaching Faith.&nbsp; Very 
well, but in what?&nbsp; Why, again says he, 
&lsquo;Faith&rsquo;&mdash;that is, Faith in Faith.&nbsp; 
Objectless, purposeless, unmeaning, disappearing, and eluding all
grasp when any occasion for action arises, when anything is to be
done, as sufficiently appears from the miserable unpracticability
of the latter chapters of the &lsquo;Chartism,&rsquo; where he 
comes forward to give directions for what is to be 
done.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FitzGerald&rsquo;s wide, albeit eclectic reading, is 
sufficiently illustrated on every page of his published 
Letters.&nbsp; When, fourteen years before his death, his 
eyesight began to fail him, he employed boy-readers, one of whom 
read him the whole of the Tichborne trial.&nbsp; One summer night
in 1889 I sat and smoked with this boy, a pleasant young man, in 
the bar-parlour of the Bull Hotel.&nbsp; He told me how Mr 
FitzGerald always gave him plenty of plum-cake, and how they used
to play piquet together.&nbsp; Only sometimes a tame mouse would 
come out and sit on the table, and then not a card must be 
dropped.&nbsp; A pretty picture!&nbsp; In the bar-parlour sat an 
oldish man, who presently <!-- page 89--><a 
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>joined in our
conversation.&nbsp; He had made the lead coffin for &ldquo;the 
old Major&rdquo; (FitzGerald&rsquo;s father), and another for Mr 
John; and he seemed half to resent that he had not performed the 
same office for Mr Edward himself, for whom, however, he once 
built a boat.&nbsp; He told me, moreover, how years before Mr 
FitzGerald had congratulated him on some symptoms of heart 
disease, had said he had it himself, and was glad of it, for 
&ldquo;when he came to die, he didn&rsquo;t want to have a lot of
women messing about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day I went and called on FitzGerald&rsquo;s old 
housekeeper, Mrs Howe, and her husband.&nbsp; She the 
&ldquo;Fairy Godmother,&rdquo; as FitzGerald delighted to call 
her, was blithe and chirpy as ever, with pleasant talk of 
&ldquo;our gentleman&rdquo;: &ldquo;So kind he was, not never one
to make no obstacles.&nbsp; Such a joky gentleman he was, 
too.&nbsp; Why, once he says to me, &lsquo;Mrs Howe, I 
didn&rsquo;t know we had express trains here.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I 
said, &lsquo;Whatever <i>do</i> you mean, sir?&rsquo; and he 
says, &lsquo;Why, look at Mrs ---&rsquo;s dress 
there.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, sure enough, she had a long train to it,
you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her husband (&ldquo;the King of 
Clubs&rdquo;) was eighty-four, but the same cheery, simple soul 
he always was.&nbsp; Mr Spalding, one broiling day, saw him 
standing bare-headed, and peering intently for good five minutes 
into the pond at Little Grange.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it, 
Howe?&rdquo; he asked him; and <!-- page 90--><a 
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>the old man 
presently answered, &ldquo;How fond them ducks dew seem of water,
<i>to</i> be sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which, for some cause or other, 
greatly tickled FitzGerald.</p>
<p>I was staying in Woodbridge at the &ldquo;Bull,&rdquo; kept 
whilom by &ldquo;good John Grout,&rdquo; from whom FitzGerald 
procured the Scotch ale which he would set to the fire till it 
&ldquo;just had a smile on it,&rdquo; and who every Christmas 
sent him a present of mince-pies and a jug of punch.&nbsp; An 
excellent man, and a mighty horse-dealer, better versed in 
horse-flesh than in literature.&nbsp; After a visit from Lord 
Tennyson, FitzGerald told Grout that Woodbridge should feel 
itself honoured.&nbsp; John had not quite understood, so 
presently took a chance of asking my father who that gentleman 
was Mr FitzGerald had been talking of.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr 
Tennyson,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;the 
poet-laureate.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Diss&aacute;y,&rdquo; <a 
name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90" 
class="citation">[90]</a> said John, warily; &ldquo;anyhow he 
didn&rsquo;t fare to know much about hosses when I showed him 
over my stables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From my bedroom window I could see FitzGerald&rsquo;s old 
lodgings over Berry&rsquo;s, where he sojourned from 1860 till 
1873.&nbsp; The cause of his leaving them is only half told in Mr
Aldis Wright&rsquo;s edition of the Letters (p. 365, 
footnote).&nbsp; Mr Berry, a small man, had taken to himself a 
second wife, a buxom widow weighing fourteen stone; <!-- page 
91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>and 
she, being very genteel, could not brook the idea of keeping a 
lodger.&nbsp; So one day&mdash;I have heard FitzGerald tell the 
story&mdash;came a timid rap at the door of his sitting-room, a 
deep &ldquo;Now, Berry, be firm,&rdquo; and a mild &ldquo;Yes, my
dear;&rdquo; and Berry appeared on the threshold.&nbsp; 
Hesitatingly he explained that &ldquo;Mrs Berry, you know, 
sir&mdash;really extremely sorry&mdash;but not been used, 
sir,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; Then from the rear, a deep 
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve got to tell him about Old Gooseberry, 
Berry,&rdquo; a deprecatory &ldquo;Certainly, my love;&rdquo; and
poor Berry stammered forth, &ldquo;And I am told, sir, that you 
said&mdash;you said&mdash;I had long been old Berry, but 
now&mdash;now you should call me Old Gooseberry.&rdquo;&nbsp; So 
FitzGerald had to make up his mind at last to migrate to his own 
house, Little Grange, which he had bought more than nine years 
before, and enlarged and made a very pretty place of.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I shall never live in it, but I shall die there,&rdquo; he
once said to a friend.&nbsp; Both predictions were falsified, for
he did live there nearly ten years, and his death took place at 
Merton, in Norfolk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p91.jpg">
<img alt="Little Grange" src="images/p91.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I wandered through the grounds of Little Grange, hardly 
changed except that there were now no doves.&nbsp; There was the 
&ldquo;Quarterdeck&rdquo; walk, and there was the Summerhouse, to
which Charles Keene used to retire with his bagpipes.&nbsp; I can
hear FitzGerald saying to my father, <!-- page 92--><a 
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>&ldquo;Keene 
has a theory that we open our mouths too much; but whether he 
bottles up his wind to play the bagpipes, or whether he plays the
bagpipes to get rid of his bottled-up wind, I do not know, and I 
don&rsquo;t suppose I ever shall know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Little Grange I walked two miles out to Bredfield Hall, 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s birthplace.&nbsp; It is a stately old Jacobean
mansion, though sadly beplastered, for surely its natural colour 
is red-brick, like that of the outbuildings.&nbsp; Among these I 
came upon an old, old labourer, who &ldquo;remembered Mr Edward 
well.&nbsp; Why, he&rsquo;d often come up, he would, and sit on 
that there bench by the canal, nivver sayin&rsquo; 
nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; But he took on wonnerful, that he did, if 
ivver they touched any of the owd trees.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not many of
them are standing now, and what there are, are all &ldquo;dying 
atop.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p93.jpg">
<img alt="The Cottage, Boulge" src="images/p93.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>It is a short walk from Bredfield Hall to Bredfield church and
vicarage.&nbsp; Both must be a good deal altered by restoration 
and enlargement since the days (1834-57) of George Crabbe, the 
poet&rsquo;s son, about whom there is so much in the Letters, and
of whom I have often heard tell.&nbsp; He went up to the great 
Exhibition of 1851; and, after his return, my father asked him 
what he thought of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thought of it, my dear 
sir!&nbsp; When I entered that vast emporium of the world&rsquo;s
commerce, I lifted <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>up my arms and <span 
class="smcap">shouted</span> for amazement.&rdquo;&nbsp; From 
Bredfield a charming walk through the fields (trudged how many 
times by FitzGerald!) leads to the little one-storeyed cottage in
Boulge Park, where he lived from 1838 till 1853.&nbsp; It 
probably is scarcely changed at all, with its low-pitched thatch 
roof forming eyebrows over the brown-shuttered windows.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Cold and draughty,&rdquo; says the woman who was living in
it, and who showed me FitzGerald&rsquo;s old parlour and 
bedroom.&nbsp; The very nails were still in the walls on which he
hung his big pictures.&nbsp; Boulge Hall, then tenantless, a 
large modern white-brick house, brought me soon to Boulge church,
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
94</span>half-hidden by trees.&nbsp; Fitzgerald sleeps beneath 
its redbrick tower.&nbsp; His grave is marked by a flat granite 
monument, carved with a cross-fleury.&nbsp; Pity, it seemed, that
no roses grew over it. <a name="citation94"></a><a 
href="#footnote94" class="citation">[94]</a></p>
<p>Afterwards, for auld langsyne, I took a long pull down the 
Deben river; and next morning I visited Farlingay Hall, the 
farmhouse where Carlyle stayed with FitzGerald in 1855.&nbsp; It 
is not a farmhouse now, but a goodly old-fashioned mansion, 
red-tiled, dormer-windowed, and all covered with roses and 
creepers.&nbsp; A charming young lady showed me some of the 
rooms, and pointed out a fine elm-tree in the meadow, beneath 
which Carlyle smoked his pipe.&nbsp; Finally, if any one would 
know more of the country round Woodbridge, let him turn up an 
article in the &lsquo;Magazine of Art&rsquo; for 1885, by 
Professor Sidney Colvin, on &ldquo;East Suffolk Memories, Inland 
and Home.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p95.jpg">
<img alt="Farlingay Hall" src="images/p95.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But, besides this, I saw a good deal of Mr John Loder, third 
in a line of Woodbridge booksellers, who knew FitzGerald for many
years, and has much to tell of him which were well worth 
preserving.&nbsp; From him I received <!-- page 96--><a 
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>a loan of Mr 
Elihu Vedder&rsquo;s splendid illustrations to the 
&lsquo;Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t,&rsquo; and a couple of 
presents.&nbsp; The first is a pencil-drawing of 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s yacht; the second, a book, &ldquo;made 
up,&rdquo; like so many others, by FitzGerald, and comprising 
this one, three French plays, a privately printed article on 
Moore, and the first edition of &lsquo;A Little Dinner at 
Timmins&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then with Mr Barrett, the Ipswich 
bookseller, who likewise knew FitzGerald, I had two chance 
meetings; and last but not least, I spent a most pleasant day at 
Colchester with Mr Frederick Spalding, curator now of the museum 
there.</p>
<p>Sitting in his alcove, hewn out of the massy wall of the 
Norman keep, he poured forth story after story of FitzGerald, and
showed me his memorials of their friendship.&nbsp; This was a 
copy of Miss Edgeworth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Frank,&rsquo; in German and
English, given to FitzGerald at Edgeworthstown (<i>cf.</i> 
&lsquo;Letters,&rsquo; p. 74); and that, FitzGerald&rsquo;s own 
school copy of Boswell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Johnson,&rsquo; which he 
gave Mr Spalding, first writing on the fly-leaf&mdash;&ldquo;He 
was pleased to say to me one morning when we were alone in his 
study, &lsquo;Boswell, I am almost easier with you than with 
anybody&rsquo; (vol. v. p. 75).&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, again, was a 
scrap-book, containing, <i>inter alia</i>, a long and interesting
unpublished letter from Carlyle to FitzGerald about the projected
Naseby monument, and a fragment of a letter from Frederic 
Tennyson, criticising <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the Laureate&rsquo;s &ldquo;Welcome 
to Alexandra.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not being a short-hand reporter or 
American interviewer, I am not going to try to reproduce Mr 
Spalding&rsquo;s discourse (he must do that himself some day); 
but a letter of his in the &lsquo;East Anglian&rsquo; of 8th July
1889 I will reprint:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The fishing Lugger built at Lowestoft was named 
the &ldquo;Meum and Tuum,&rdquo; commonly called by the fishermen
there the &ldquo;Mum and Tum,&rdquo; much to Mr 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s amusement; and the ship alluded to by Mr Gosse
was the pretty schooner of 15 tons, built by Harvey, of Wyvenhoe,
and named the &ldquo;Scandal,&rdquo; after &ldquo;the main staple
of Woodbridge.&rdquo;&nbsp; My friend, T. N., the skipper, gave a
different account of the origin of the name.&nbsp; I was standing
with him on the Lowestoft Fish Market, close to which the little 
&ldquo;Scandal&rdquo; was moored, after an early dive from her 
deck, when Tom was addressed by one of two ladies: &ldquo;Pray, 
my man, can you tell me who owns that very pretty 
yacht?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr Edward FitzGerald of Woodbridge, 
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Tom, touching his cap.&nbsp; &ldquo;And 
can you tell us her name?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
&lsquo;Scandal,&rsquo; ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me! 
how came he to select such a very peculiar name?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, the fact is, all the other names were 
taken up, so that we were forced to have either that or 
none.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ladies at once moved on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Spalding, further, has placed in my hands a bundle of 
seventy letters, written to himself by FitzGerald between 1862 
and 1882.&nbsp; Some of them relate to mere business matters 
(such as the building of Little Grange), and some to private 
affairs; but the following extracts <!-- page 98--><a 
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>have a high 
and exceptional value, as illustrating a feature in 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s life that is little touched on in the 
published Letters&mdash;his strong love of the sea and of 
sailors:&mdash;</p>

Boat of about 14 feet on speculation: and has laid down the keel

Indeed the <i>Rail</i> now begins to creep over the Marsh, and 
even to come pretty close to the River, over which it is to cross
into Beccles.&nbsp; But you, I think, surmise that this Rail will
not hurt Wright so much as he fears it will.&nbsp; Poor old 
Boy&mdash;I found him well and hearty on Sunday; but on Sunday 
night and Monday he was seized with such Rheumatism (I think 
Rheumatic Gout) in one leg as has given him no rest or sleep

a-tearin&rsquo; the Flesh off his Bones.&rsquo;&nbsp; I showed 
him two of the guilty Screws which had almost let my Leaden Keel 
part from the wooden one: he says he had desired the Smith not to
make <i>too</i> large heads, and the Smith accordingly made them

even<sup>g</sup>.&nbsp; Wednesday I sent Newson and Crew over to 
Portsmouth, where they didn&rsquo;t see the one thing I sent them
for, namely, Nelson&rsquo;s Ship, the &lsquo;Victory,&rsquo; but 
where they bought two Pair of Trousers, which they call 
&lsquo;Dungaree.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 102--><a 
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Yesterday 
we went to Poole&mdash;a place I had long a very slight Desire to
see; and which was not worth the seeing.&nbsp; To-day we came 
back here: I regretting rather we had not run further along the 
Coast to Weymouth and Teignmouth, where I should have seen my 
Friend Mansfield the Shipwright.&nbsp; It was a little weakness 
of mine, in <i>not</i> changing orders, but, having talked of 
going only to Poole, I left it as it was.&nbsp; The weather has 
been only <i>too</i> fine: the sea too calm.&nbsp; Here we are in
front of this pretty place, with many Yachts at anchor and 
sailing about us: nearly all Schooners, little and great, of all 
which I think we are the &lsquo;Pitman&rsquo; (see Moor&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Words&rsquo;).&nbsp; I must say I am very tired of seeing 
only Schooners.&nbsp; Newson was beaten horribly yesterday by a 
Ryde open Boat of about 7 or 8 tons, which stood right into the 
wind, but he soon afterwards completely distanced a Billy-boy, 
which put us in Spirits again.&nbsp; I am very contented (in my 
way) pottering about here alone, or with my Crew of two, and I 
believe c<sup>d</sup> bundle on for a Month in such a way.&nbsp; 
But I shall soon be home.&nbsp; I have thought of you To-day when
your Sale is going on, at the same time as my <i>Sail</i>.&nbsp; 
Pretty Wit! . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next letter refers to an accident that befell the <!-- 
page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
103</span>Scandal.&nbsp; She was lying at Lowestoft, in the 
Fishmarket basin, when a huge Continental steamer came drifting 
down on her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr FitzGerald,&rdquo; so Mr Spalding 
tells me, &ldquo;just said in his slow melodious voice, <a 
name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103" 
class="citation">[103]</a> &lsquo;My poor little ship will be 
cracked like a nutshell;&rsquo; and he took my arm to force me 
ashore.&nbsp; But I refused to go unless he went too, and just 
then the cable held on the weather-side of the steamer towering 
up above us; still, our &lsquo;channel-boards,&rsquo; over which 
the shrouds are tautened, were crushed up flat to the 
yacht&rsquo;s side, and perhaps some stanchions were injured 
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Scandal</span>, <i>Sept.</i> 19, &rsquo;66.&nbsp; 
[Ib.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . Mr Manby is wrong about our getting no 
compensation for the Damage (so far as it c<sup>d</sup> be 
<i>seen</i>) inflicted on us by the steamer.&nbsp; Whether we 
could <i>claim</i> it or not, the Steamer Captain granted it: 
being (as Newson says) quite a Gentleman, &amp;c.&nbsp; So we 
have had the Carpenters for two Days, who have restored the 
broken Stanchions, <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>&amp;c.&nbsp; What mischief the 
Shock may have done to the Body of the Ship remains to be proved:
&lsquo;Anyhow, it can&rsquo;t have done her any good,&rsquo; says
Job&rsquo;s Comforter, Capt<sup>n</sup>. Newson.&nbsp; The 
Steamer&rsquo;s Captain admitted that he had expected us to be 
cracked like a Walnut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I want you to tell me of this.&nbsp; You know of 
Newson&rsquo;s lending <i>Posh</i> <a name="citation104"></a><a 
href="#footnote104" class="citation">[104]</a> money.&nbsp; I 
have advised that, beside an I.O.U. from Posh, he should give 
security upon some of his Effects: Boats, Nets, or other 
Gear.&nbsp; Tell me how this should be done, if you can: the Form
of Writing required: and perhaps what Interest Newson should have
on his Money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night at the &lsquo;Suffolk&rsquo; I was where 
Newson, Posh, &amp; Co. were at their Ale: a little of which got 
into Newson&rsquo;s head: who began to touch up Posh about such 
an Apparatus of Rockets, Mortars, etc., for the Rescue of those 
two stranded Vessels, when he declares that he and one or two 
Felixstowe Men would have pushed off a Boat through the pauses of
the Surf, and done all that was wanted.&nbsp; <i>He</i> had seen,
and been on, the Shipwash scores of times when the jump of the 
Ship pitched him on his Back, and sent the Topmast flying.&nbsp; 
So had Posh <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>on the Home-sand here, he said; his 
Sand was just as bad as Tom&rsquo;s, he knew; and the Lowestoft 
Men just as good as the Felixstowe, &amp;c.&nbsp; I fomented the 
Quarrel gently:&mdash;no <i>Quarrel</i>, or I should not: all 
Newson meant (which I believe is very true) there are so 
<i>many</i> men here, and no <i>one Man to command</i>, that they
are worse off with all their Men and Boats than at the Ferry 
[Bawdsey], where Newson or Percival are Spokesmen and 
Masters.&nbsp; This I have explained to Posh To-day, as he was 
sitting, like Abraham, in his Tent&mdash;like an Apostle, mending
his nets.&nbsp; &lsquo;Posh, your Frill was out last 
night?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;only I didn&rsquo;t 
like to hear the Lowestoft Chaps weren&rsquo;t as good, etc., 
especially before the Stranger Men from Harwich, 
etc.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;. . . &lsquo;Posh&rsquo; went off in his new, old 
Lugger, <a name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105" 
class="citation">[105]</a> which I call &lsquo;The 
Porpoise,&rsquo; on Thursday: came in yesterday with a Last and a
half of Herrings: and is just put to Sea again, Sunday though it 
be.&nbsp; It is reported to be an extraordinary Herring Year, 
<i>along shore</i>: and now he goes into deeper Water.&nbsp; I am
amused to see Newson&rsquo;s <i>devotion</i> to his younger 
Friend: he won&rsquo;t leave him a moment if possible, was the 
first to see him come in <!-- page 106--><a 
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>yesterday, 
and has just watched him out of sight.&nbsp; He declined having 
any Bill of Sale on Posh&rsquo;s Goods for Money lent; old as he 
is (enough to distrust all Mankind)&mdash;has perfect reliance on
his Honour, Industry, Skill, and Luck.&nbsp; This is a pretty 
Sight to me.&nbsp; I tell Newson he has at last found his Master,
and become possessed of that troublesome thing: an anxious Regard
for some one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was noticing for several Days how many <i>Robins</i> 
were singing along the &lsquo;London Road&rsquo; here; and 
(without my speaking of it) Lusia Kerrich told me they had almost
a <i>Plague</i> of Robins at <i>Gelson</i> [Geldestone]: 3 or 4 
coming into the Breakfast room every morning; getting under 
Kerrich&rsquo;s Legs, &amp;c.&nbsp; And yesterday Posh told me 
that <i>three</i> came to his Lugger out at Sea; also another 
very pretty Bird, whose name he didn&rsquo;t know, but which he 
caught and caged in <i>the Binnacle</i>, where it was found dead 
in due time. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Posh (as Cooper, whom I question, 
tells me) was <i>over</i> 12 <i>miles from Land</i> when the 
<i>four</i> Robins came aboard: a Bird which he nor Cooper had 
ever seen to visit a Ship before.&nbsp; The Bird he shut up in 
the Binnacle he describes as of &lsquo;all sorts of 
Colours&rsquo;&mdash;perhaps a Tomtit!&mdash;and I fear it was 
<i>roasted</i> in the Binnacle, when Posh lighted up at night, 
forgetting his Guest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor little 
fallow!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you can&rsquo;t come, but have no doubt that
you are right in <i>not</i> coming.&nbsp; You may imagine what I 
do with myself here: somehow, I do believe the Seaside is more of
my Element than elsewhere, and the old Lodging Life suits me 
best.&nbsp; That, however, I have at Woodbridge; and can be 
better treated nowhere than there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just seen Posh, who had been shooting his Lines 
in the Morning: had fallen asleep after his Sunday Dinner, and 
rose up like a Giant refreshed when I went into his house.&nbsp; 
His little Wife, however, told him he must go and tidy his Hair, 
which he was preparing to obey.&nbsp; Oh! these are the People 
who somehow interest me; and if I were not now too far advanced 
on the Road to Forgetfulness, I should be sad that my own Life 
had been such a wretched Concern in comparison.&nbsp; But it is 
too late, even to lament, now. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a Wedding-party next door: at No. 11; I being

<p>&ldquo;I really was to have gone home To-day, but made a 
little Business with Posh an excuse for waiting over 
Sunday.&nbsp; This very Day he signs an Agreement for a new 
Herring-lugger, of which he is to be Captain, and to which he 
will contribute some Nets and Gear.&nbsp; I daresay I had better 
have left all this alone: but, if moderately lucky, the Vessel 
will pay <i>something</i>, at any rate: and in the meanwhile it 
really does me some good, I believe, to set up this little 
Interest here: and even if I lose money, I get some Fun for 
it.&nbsp; So now I shall be very glad to drop <i>Esquire</i>, and
be addressed, as &lsquo;<i>Herring-merchant</i>,&rsquo; for the 
future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Posh has been doing well this week with Cod-fishing, as
only one other Boat has been out (owing to the others not having 
a <i>Set-net</i> to catch bait with).&nbsp; His fish have fetched
a good price, even from the old Jew, Levi. <a

which his quiet little Wife keeps tidy and pleasant.&nbsp; The 
Man is, I do think, of a Royal Nature.&nbsp; I have told him he 
is liable to one Danger (the Hare with many Friends)&mdash;so 
many wanting him <i>to drink</i>.&nbsp; He says, it&rsquo;s quite
true, and that he is often obliged to run away: as I believe he 
does: for his House shows all Temperance and Order.&nbsp; This 
little Lecture I give him&mdash;to go the way, I suppose, of all 
such Advice. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Posh shall be at the Train for his Hare.&nbsp; When I 
went to look for him last Night, he was in his <i>Shod</i>, by 
the light of a Candle examining a <i>Petman</i> Pig [Suffolk for 
&lsquo;the smallest pig in a litter&rsquo;], about the size of 
Newson&rsquo;s Watch, and swell&rsquo;d out &lsquo;as <i>taut</i>
as a Drum,&rsquo; Posh said.&nbsp; A Friend had given him this 
Production of Nature: it hadn&rsquo;t grown a bit (except 
swelling up) for 3 weeks, in spite of Posh&rsquo;s Medicines last
Sunday: so as he is &lsquo;a&rsquo;most minded to make away with 
it, poor little thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; He almost let it drop when I 
suddenly appeared, in a theatrical Style, at the Door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to think there is no hurry about a Gardener

thinks that Miss ---&rsquo;s man would do well: as it is, he goes

him.&nbsp; He and his Wife are very respectable too, I 
hear.&nbsp; So in spite of my Fear of Unprotected Females, 
&amp;c., he might do.&nbsp; Perhaps you might see him one day as 
you pass the Unprotected one&rsquo;s Grounds, and hear.&nbsp; I 
have hardly work enough for one Whole Man, as is the case with my

<p>&ldquo;. . . Posh is very busy with his Lugger [the 
&lsquo;Meum and Tuum&rsquo;], which will be decked by the middle 
of next Week.&nbsp; I have just left him: having caught him with 
a Pot of white paint (some of which was on his Face), and having 
made him dine on cold Beef in the Suffolk Hotel Bowling-green, 
washing all down with two Tankards of Bullard&rsquo;s Ale.&nbsp; 
He was not displeased to dine abroad; as this is Saturday, when 
he says there are apt to be &lsquo;Squalls&rsquo; at home, 
because of washing, &amp;c.&nbsp; His little Boy is on the 
mending hand: safe, indeed, I hope, and believe, unless they let 
him into Draughts of Air: which I have warned them against.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday we went to Yarmouth, and bought a Boat for 
the Lugger, and paraded the Town, and dined at the <!-- page 
111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
111</span>Star Tavern (<i>Beefsteak for one</i>), and looked into
the Great Church: where when Posh pulled off his Cap, and stood 
erect but not irreverent, I thought he looked as good an Image of
the Mould that Man was originally cast in, as you may chance to 
see in the Temple of <i>The Maker</i> in these Days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Artillery were blazing away on the Denes; and the 
little Band-master, who played with his Troop here last summer, 
joined us as we were walking, and told Posh not to lag behind, 
for he was not at all ashamed to be seen walking with him.&nbsp;

<p>&ldquo;. . . As to talking over Posh, etc., with me, there is 
plenty of time for that; indeed, as yet we <i>cannot</i> come to 
a final estimate of the Property, since all is not yet bought: 
sails, cables, warps, Ballast, &amp;c.&nbsp; As to his services 
hitherto, I yesterday gave him &pound;20, telling him that 
<i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t compute how much he had done for me: nor 
could he, he said, and would be contented with anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No cloven Hoof as yet!&nbsp; It was his Birthday 
(yesterday), and we all had a walk to the new Lugger, and then to
Mutford, where we had a fresh-water Sail on the <!-- page

whom Posh does the honours of the place.&nbsp; <i>He</i> is still

believe that he and I shall now sign the Mortgage Papers that

see no prospect of change in the weather till the Mackerel shall

come in Day after day so poorly stored after all the Labour and 
Time and Anxiety given to the work by her Crew; but I can do no 
more, and at any-rate take my own share of the Loss very 
lightly.&nbsp; I can afford it better than they can.&nbsp; I have
told Newson to set sail and run home any Day, Hour, or Minute, 
when he wishes to see his Wife and Family.&nbsp; But at present 
he seems contented to eat Fish here: whether some of the few 
&lsquo;<i>Stulls</i>&rsquo; <a name="citation113"></a><a

in, or what his now innumerable friends the Trawlers are always 
offering.&nbsp; In fact, I think Newson looks to Lowestoft as a 
Summer Pasture, and is in no hurry to leave it.&nbsp; He lives 
here well for nothing, except Bread, Cheese, and Tea and 
Sugar.&nbsp; He has now taken to Cocoa, however, which he calls

little better luck than hitherto.&nbsp; One reason for my not 
going to Woodbridge is, that I think it possible this N.E. wind 
may blow him hither to tan his nets.&nbsp; Only please God it

<p>&ldquo;Lord and Lady Hatherley were here last week&mdash;no, 
<i>this</i> week: and I met them on the pier one day, as 
unaffected as ever.&nbsp; He is obliged, I believe, to carry the 
<!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

could submit to be so bored; on which my lady put in about 
&ldquo;Sense of Duty,&rdquo; etcetera-rorum.&nbsp; But I (having 
no Great Seal to carry) went off to Southwold on Wednesday, and 
lay off there in the calm nights till yesterday: going to 
Dunwich, which seemed to me rather delightful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newson brought in another Moth some days ago; brownish,
with a red rump.&nbsp; I dare say very common, but I have taken 
enormous pains to murder it: buying a lump of some poison at 
Southwold which the Chemist warned me to throw overboard directly
the Moth was done for: for fear of Jack and Newson being found 
dead in their rugs.&nbsp; The Moth is now pinned down in a 
lucifer match box, awaiting your inspection.&nbsp; You know I

<p>&ldquo;I wish you <i>were</i> coming here this Evening, as I 
have several things to talk over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not meddle with the Regatta&mdash;to 
Newson&rsquo;s sorrow, who certainly <i>must</i> have carried off
the second &pound;10 prize.&nbsp; And the Day ended by vexing me 
more than it did him.&nbsp; Posh drove in here the day before to 
tan his nets: could not help making one with some old friends 
<!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
116</span>in a Boat-race on the Monday, and getting very fuddled 
with them on the Suffolk Green (where I was) at night.&nbsp; 
After all the pains I have taken, and all the real anxiety I have
had.&nbsp; And worst of all, after the repeated promises he had 
made!&nbsp; I said, there must now be an end of Confidence 
between us, so far as <i>that</i> was concerned, and I would so 
far trouble myself about him no more.&nbsp; But when I came to 
reflect that this was but an outbreak among old friends on an old
occasion, after (I do believe) months of sobriety; that there was
no concealment about it; and that though obstinate at first as to
how little drunk, &amp;c., he was very repentant 
afterwards&mdash;I cannot let this one flaw weigh against the 
general good of the man.&nbsp; I cannot if I would: what then is 
the use of trying?&nbsp; But my confidence in <i>that</i> respect
must be so far shaken, and it vexes me to think that I can never 
be <i>sure</i> of his not being overtaken so.&nbsp; I declare 
that it makes me feel ashamed very much to play the Judge on one 
who stands immeasurably above me in the scale, whose faults are 
better than so many virtues.&nbsp; Was not this very outbreak 
that of a great genial Boy among his old Fellows?&nbsp; True, a 
Promise was broken.&nbsp; Yes: but if the Whole Man be of the 
Royal Blood of Humanity, and do Justice in the Main, what are 
<i>the people</i> to say?&nbsp; <i>He</i> thought, if he thought 
at all, that he kept his promise <!-- page 117--><a 
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>in the 
main.&nbsp; But there is no use talking: unless I part company 
wholly, I suppose I must take the evil with the good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Winter will soon be here, and no more 
&lsquo;Suffolk&rsquo; Bowling-greens.&nbsp; Once more I want you 
to help in finding me a lad, or boy, or lout, who will help me to
get through the long Winter nights&mdash;whether by cards or 
reading&mdash;now that my eyes are not so up to their work as 
they were.&nbsp; I think they are a <i>little</i> better: which I
attribute to the wearing of these hideous Goggles, which keep out
Sun, Sea, Sand, &amp;c.&nbsp; But I must not, if I could, tax 
them as I have done over books by lamplight till Midnight.&nbsp; 
Do pray consider this for me, and look about.&nbsp; I thought of 
a sharp lad&mdash;that son of the Broker&mdash;if he could read a
little decently he would do.&nbsp; Really one has lived quite 
long enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;will be very glad to show you his place at any 
time.&nbsp; His Wife is really a very nice Lady, and his Boy one 
of the nicest I have seen these 30 years.&nbsp; He himself sees 
wonderful things: he saw 2 sharks (supposed by Newson to be Sweet
Williams) making love together out of the water at Covehithe; and
a shoal of Porpoises tossing up a Halibut into the Air and 
catching it again.&nbsp; You may imagine Newson&rsquo;s demure 
face listening to all this, and his comments afterwards. . .

[Ib.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you much for your Letter, which I got last night 
when I went for my usual dose of Grog and Pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Posh came up with his Lugger last Friday, with a lot of
torn nets, and went off again on Sunday.&nbsp; <i>I thought</i> 
he was wrong to come up, and not to transmit his nets by Rail, as
is often done at 6d. a net.&nbsp; But I did not say so to 
him,&mdash;it is no unamiable point in him to love <i>home</i>: 
but I think he won&rsquo;t make a fortune by it.&nbsp; However, I
may be very wrong in thinking he had better <i>not</i> have 
come.&nbsp; He has made about the average fishing, I believe: 
about &pound;250.&nbsp; Some boats have &pound;600, I hear; and 
some few not enough to pay their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came up with a very bad cold and hoarseness; and so 
went off, poor fellow: he never will be long well, I do 
think.&nbsp; I was foolish to forget G. Crabbe&rsquo;s 
hom&oelig;opathic <i>Aconite</i>: but I sent off some pills of it
to Grimsby last night. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;. . . Posh has, I believe, gone off to Southwold in 
hope to bring his Lugger home.&nbsp; I advised him last night to 
ascertain first by Letter whether she <i>were</i> ready for his 
hands; but you know he will go his own way, and that generally is
as good as anybody&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He now works all day <!-- page 
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>in
his Net-loft; and I wonder how he keeps as well as he is, shut up
there from fresh Air, and among frowzy Nets.&nbsp; But he is in 
good Spirits; and that goes some way to keep the Body well, you 
know.&nbsp; I think he has mistaken in not sending the Meum and 
Tuum to the West this Spring, not because the Weather seems to 
promise in all ways so much better than last (for <i>that</i> no 
one could anticipate), but on account of the high Price of Fish 
of any sort; which has been an evident fact for the last six 
months.&nbsp; But I have not meddled, nor indeed is it my 
Business to meddle now. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;. . . Indeed, I only write now because I am shut up in 
my ship by rain, and so write letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a letter from Posh yesterday, telling me he was 
sorry we had not &lsquo;parted Friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; That he had 
been indeed &lsquo;<i>a little the worse</i> for 
Drink&rsquo;&mdash;which means being at a Public-house half the 
Day, and having to sleep it off the remainder: having been duly 
warned by his Father at Noon that all had been ready for sailing 
2 hours before, and all the other Luggers gone.&nbsp; As Posh 
could <i>walk</i>, I suppose he only acknowledges a <i>little</i>
Drink; but, judging by what followed on that little Drink, I wish
he had simply acknowledged his Fault.&nbsp; He begs me to write: 
if I <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>do so, I must speak very plainly to 
him: that, with all his noble Qualities, I doubt that I can never
again have Confidence in his Promise to break this one bad Habit,
seeing that he has broken it so soon, when there was no occasion 
or excuse: unless it were the thought of leaving his Wife so ill 
at home.&nbsp; The Man is so beyond others, as I think, that I 
have come to feel that I must not condemn him by general rule; 
nevertheless, if he ask me, I can refer him to no other.&nbsp; I 
must send him back his own written Promise of Sobriety, signed 
only a month before he broke it so needlessly: and I must even 
tell him that I know not yet if he can be left with the Mortgage 
as we settled it in May. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I enclose Posh&rsquo;s letter, and 
the answer I propose to give to it.&nbsp; I am sure it makes me 
sad and ashamed to be setting up for Judge on a much nobler 
Creature than myself.&nbsp; But I must consider this a case in 
which the outbreak was worse than needless, and such as must 
almost destroy any Confidence I can feel for the future.&nbsp; I 
can only excuse it as a sort of Desperation at his Wife&rsquo;s 
Illness&mdash;strange way as he took of improving the 
occasion.&nbsp; You see it was <i>not</i> old Friends not seen 
for some time, but one or two of the Crew he is always with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had thought of returning him <i>his</i> written 
Promise as <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>worthless: desiring back my 
Direction to my Heirs that he should keep on the lugger in case 
of my Death.&nbsp; But I will wait for what you say about all 
this.&nbsp; I am really sorry to trouble you over and over again 
with the matter.&nbsp; But I am so fearful of blundering, where a
Blunder may do so much harm.&nbsp; I think that Posh ought to be 
made to feel this severely: and, as his Wife is better, I do not 
mind making him feel it, if I can.&nbsp; On the other hand, I do 
not wish to drive him, by Despair, into the very fault which I 
have so tried to cure him of.&nbsp; Pray do consider, and write 
to me of this, returning me the two Papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His mother did not try to excuse him at all: his Father
would not even see him go off.&nbsp; She merely told me 
parenthetically, &lsquo;I tell him he seem to do it when the 
Governor is here.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation121"></a><a

<p>&ldquo;. . . The two Hens travelled so comfortably, that, when
let out of the basket, they fed, and then fought together.&nbsp; 
<i>Your</i> Hen was pronounced a Beauty by Posh &amp; Co.&nbsp; 
As for mine, she stood up and crew like a Cock three times right 
on end, as Posh reports: a command of <!-- page 122--><a

Hen reputed so unlucky <a name="citation122"></a><a

Fletcher, Senior, who had known of sad results from such 
unnatural exhibitions, recommended her being slain and stewed 
down forthwith.&nbsp; Posh, however, resolves to abide the 
upshot. . . .&nbsp; Posh and his Father are very busy getting the
Meum and Tuum ready for the West; Jemmy, who goes Captain, is 
just now in France with a <i>Cargoe</i> of salt Herrings.&nbsp; I
suppose the Lugger will start in a fortnight or so.&nbsp; My Eyes
refuse reading here, so I sit looking at the sea (with shut 
eyes), or gossiping with the women in the Net-loft.&nbsp; 
All-fours at night.&nbsp; Thank you for the speckled Hen; Posh 
expressed himself much obliged for his. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;. . . Posh&mdash;after no fish caught for 3 
weeks&mdash;has had his boat come home with nearly all her fleet 
of nets torn to pieces in last week&rsquo;s winds.&nbsp; On 
Wednesday he had to go 8 miles on the other side of Halesworth 
after a runaway&mdash;came home, drenched from top to toe, with a
great Bulrush in his hand, which he could not help admiring as he
went along: and went with me to the Theatre afterwards, where he 
admired the &lsquo;Gays,&rsquo; as he <!-- page 123--><a

Notice, which was up last Monday, was enough.&nbsp; Against that 
I have to say, that, after giving that Notice, he told George 
Moor that I might stay while I pleased; and he drove me away for 
a week by having no one but his own blind Aunt to wait on 
me.&nbsp; What miserable little things!&nbsp; They do not at all 
irritate, but only <i>bore</i> me.&nbsp; I have seen no more of 
Fletcher since I wrote, though he called once when I was 
out.&nbsp; I have left word at his house, that, if he wishes to 
see me before I go, here am I to be found at tea-time.&nbsp; I 
only hope he has taken no desperate step.&nbsp; I hope so for his
Family&rsquo;s sake, including Father and Mother.&nbsp; People 
here have asked me if he is not going to give up the Business, 
&amp;c.&nbsp; Yet there is Greatness about the Man: I believe his
want of Conscience in some particulars is to be referred to his 
<i>Salwaging</i> Ethics; and your Cromwells, C&aelig;sars, and 
Napoleons have not been more scrupulous.&nbsp; But I shall part 
Company with him if I can do so without Injury to his 
Family.&nbsp; If not, I must let him go on <i>under some</i>

such a brave, pious word in return that I keep to show you.&nbsp;

previous Mrs Howe had been suffering so from Rheumatism that she 
had been kept awake in pain, and could scarce move about by day, 
though she did the house work as usual, and would not tell 
me.&nbsp; I sent for Mr Jones at once, and got Mrs Cooper in, and
now Mrs H. is better, she <i>says</i>.&nbsp; But as I tell her,

<p>The poem turned up in a MS. book of my father&rsquo;s, while 
this article was writing.&nbsp; It is a version of the 
&ldquo;Lucius &AElig;milius Paullus,&rdquo; already published by 
Mr Aldis Wright, in vol. ii. p. 483 of the &lsquo;Remains,&rsquo;
but the two differ so widely that lovers of FitzGerald will be 
glad to have it.&nbsp; Here, then, it is:&mdash;</p>

Who has so lately witness&rsquo;d through her Streets,<br />
Together, moving with unequal March,<br />
My Triumph and the Funeral of my Sons.<br />
Yet bear with me if in a few brief words,<br />
And no invidious Spirit, I compare<br />
With the full measure of the general Joy<br />
My private Destitution.&nbsp; When the Fleet<br />
Was all equipp&rsquo;d, &rsquo;twas at the break of day<br />
That I weigh&rsquo;d anchor from Brundusium;<br />
Before the day went down, with all my Ships<br />
I made Corcyra; thence, upon the fifth,<br />
To Delphi; where to the presiding God<br />
A lustratory Sacrifice I made,<br />
As for myself, so for the Fleet and Army.<br />
Thence in five days I reach&rsquo;d the Roman camp;<br />
Took the command; re-organis&rsquo;d the War;<br />
And, for King Perseus would not forth to fight,<br />
And for his camp&rsquo;s strength could not forth be forced,<br 
/>
I slipped between his Outposts by the woods<br />
At Petra, thence I follow&rsquo;d him, when he<br />
Fight me must needs, I fought and routed him,<br />
Into the all-constraining Arms of Rome<br />
Reduced all Macedonia.<br />
And this grave War that, growing year by year,<br />

Than from his predecessor he took up,<br />
In fifteen days victoriously I closed.<br />
With that the Flood of Fortune, setting in<br />
Roll&rsquo;d wave on wave upon us.&nbsp; Macedon<br />
Once fall&rsquo;n, her States and Cities all gave in,<br />
The royal Treasure dropt into my Hands;<br />
And then the King himself, he and his Sons,<br />
As by the finger of the Gods betray&rsquo;d,<br />
Trapp&rsquo;d in the Temple they took refuge in.<br />
And now began my over-swelling Fortune<br />
To look suspicious in mine eyes.&nbsp; I fear&rsquo;d<br />
The dangerous Seas that were to carry back<br />
The fruit of such a Conquest and the Host<br />
Whose arms had reap&rsquo;d it all.&nbsp; My fear was vain:<br />
The Seas were laid, the Wind was fair, we touch&rsquo;d<br />
Our own Italian Earth once more.&nbsp; And then<br />
When nothing seem&rsquo;d to pray for, yet I pray&rsquo;d;<br />
That because Fortune, having reach&rsquo;d her height,<br />
Forthwith begins as fatal a decline,<br />
Her fall might but involve myself alone,<br />
And glance beside my Country.&nbsp; Be it so!<br />
By my sole ruin may the jealous Gods<br />
Absolve the Common-weal&mdash;by mine&mdash;by me,<br />
Of whose triumphal Pomp the front and rear&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
131</span>O scorn of human Glory&mdash;was begun<br />
And closed with the dead bodies of my Sons.<br />
Yes, I the Conqueror, and conquer&rsquo;d Perseus,<br />
Before you two notorious Monuments<br />
Stand here of human Instability.<br />
He that was late so absolute a King<br />
Now, captive led before my Chariot, sees<br />
His sons led with him captive&mdash;but alive;<br />
While I, the Conqueror, scarce had turn&rsquo;d my face<br />
From one lost son&rsquo;s still smoking Funeral,<br />
And from my Triumph to the Capitol<br />
Return&mdash;return in time to catch the last<br />
Sigh of the last that I might call my Son,<br />
Last of so many Children that should bear<br />
My name to Aftertime.&nbsp; For blind to Fate,<br />
And over-affluent of Posterity,<br />
The two surviving Scions of my Blood<br />
I had engrafted in an alien Stock,<br />
And now, beside himself, no one survives<br />
Of the old House of Paullus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Myself, on the whole, I greatly prefer this version to Mr 
Aldis Wright&rsquo;s: still, which is the later, which the 
earlier, it were hard to determine on internal grounds.&nbsp; 
For, as has befallen many a greater poet, FitzGerald&rsquo;s <!--
page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
132</span>alterations were by no means always improvements.&nbsp;
One sees this in the various editions of his masterpiece, the 
&lsquo;Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, by a 
comparison of the date (1856) on the fly-leaf of my 
father&rsquo;s notebook with that of a published letter of 
FitzGerald&rsquo;s to Professor Cowell (May 28, 1868), I am led 
to conclude that my father&rsquo;s copy is an early draft.</p>

Phrenology, answered with equal promptitude and gravity, &lsquo;I
never keep it and never use it.&nbsp; But I have heard that,

<p><a name="footnote58d"></a><a href="#citation58d" 
class="footnote">[58d]</a>&nbsp; But the &ldquo;sore 
back&rdquo;!&nbsp; It evidently alludes to some special ailment, 
one which would make it difficult for any one to <i>ride</i> 
her.</p>
<p><a name="footnote58e"></a><a href="#citation58e" 
class="footnote">[58e]</a>&nbsp; So an &ldquo;old sack&rdquo; was
thrown over her.&nbsp; Some such measures have from earliest 
times been found necessary to enable each occupant of the 
different <i>sees</i> to keep his <i>seat</i> and maintain 
order.&nbsp; In older times &ldquo;Canons&rdquo; were made; of 
late other measures have been taken&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, &ldquo;An 
Act for the Regulation of Divine Service.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sack 
was then &ldquo;hullt on,&rdquo;&mdash;thrown on,&mdash;but 
roughly, not gently.&nbsp; This is noteworthy.</p>
<p><a name="footnote59a"></a><a href="#citation59a" 
class="footnote">[59a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Corn in the sieve&rdquo; 
evidently refers to some more <i>palatable</i> measure than the 
&ldquo;old sack.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Give her some oats, do not 
give her the sack only.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps the Ecclesiastical 
Commissioners may represent the present givers of corn.</p>
<p><a name="footnote59b"></a><a href="#citation59b" 
class="footnote">[59b]</a>&nbsp; But all in vain, whether to 
enable the riders to mount on the &ldquo;sore back,&rdquo; or for

<p><a name="footnote59d"></a><a href="#citation59d"

means also <i>disendowed</i>.&nbsp; Else, what of &ldquo;all the 
dogs in the town,&rdquo; each craving and clamouring for his 
bone?&nbsp; It was so three hundred years ago.&nbsp; Each dog 
&ldquo;<i>sp&#335;ok</i> for a bone,&rdquo; and <i>got

<p><a name="footnote59e"></a><a href="#citation59e" 
class="footnote">[59e]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;All but the 
Parson&rsquo;s dog.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor vicars never got back a
bit of the impropriate tithes; the seats of learning got 
comparatively little.&nbsp; The &ldquo;dogs about town&rdquo; got
most.&nbsp; Then, in the last touching words, &ldquo;the

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
